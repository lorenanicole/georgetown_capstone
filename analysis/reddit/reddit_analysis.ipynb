So you can play your utility supports and try to win off that. Or play all-in lanes and look to snowball early. Feels like everything works with her because her kit is very diverse.  \\nCaitlyn, because she has really good bully potential as well as wave control. Her high range in good player hands is an insane advantage, because you can outrade enemy duo most of the time. It also helps her stay out of danger more easily due to higher range, which is really important factor.  \\nKalista, she can by herself win some matchups.

He decides which map side has pressure, can you play upwards in lane or you have to play safe. That said, if your jungler is very inactive, you got yourself a hard game ahead where you have to have at least 1 lane to brute force snowballing to simulate pressure on their own. Why pressure is important? Because that's where you have to play around as support with your vision and abilities most of the time when opportunity is right.  \\nAnyhow to shortly answer your question, most likely you gonna lose unless you roam with jungler and maybe try to invade bot side or stop being even bot and create advantage. If your solo lanes are losing you must have pressure bottom to equalize it and have any chance at winning. It also heavily relies on team composition. Maybe it's expected to lose most of the lanes early to turn the tides later on. This happens in pro play as well.  \\nLink me your op.gg and I can give you more direct advice.  \\n  \\nFor your elo I would recommend playing more aggressive to gain advantage on your own. Your skill level of players choke on correct trades and strong positioning A LOT. I really can't give more detailed tips cause I don't know what champs you play.  \\n  \\nWhen it comes to learning, I always look at korean master+ players who play that champ a lot on current or at least previous patch. I look for runes/masteries/items. Then I try to understand why they run that and try to make my own setup and builds while taking in their ideas. Then after trying 10 or so games in rankeds I learn playstyle of champion, weakness and strengths and try to watch replays of them or other pro players in recent patch to see how they play around those things.

Not sure why you prefer 0.5% health yellows over flat hp or at least armor. To gain value out of these you would need to stack hp, which comes way later and game might be already decided. Avoid using scaling runes on supports! Flat stats are what you looking for usually. I highly recommend flat hp yellows, in total they give extra 72 hp which is bonkers! For the same reason use flat armor quints, not scaling!!  \\nWhen it comes to ability maxing, I don't personally play Taric so I can't give you my own reliable experience input but from what I know, it's similar to Lulu where champion is flexible and you can max what you prefer. From what I played I like maxing E first on Taric because it gives way more damage in lane. It also seems to be more popular choice among other Taric players in Korea. That said, Q max is fine as well as long as you are more passive type of player (which I am against in your elo if you want to climb).  \\nBuild wise, I can't really recommend something because it's very flexible especially after ardent nerfs. I would prefer ardent/redemption first over locket because locket scales of hp and it gives flat resistances so buying it later gives more value than rushing it.  \\nGeneral climbing tips, stop playing flex. Every flex game means 1 less game in soloQ. Because you play soloQ as support you don't get autofilled so learn something safe on off-role if you really need it but stick to support role as much as possible and dodge if you need.

As others have said, actual smurfs are relatively reliably picked out of the noob queue and put into their own (maybe around level 7-10ish) as that skill level becomes apparent to the system.

League requires a base amount of data to work with for you and it takes maybe 20-30+ games to get that base data from your play over time.\\n\\n\\nB. People who are just picking up this game often do not realize what a tremendous learning curve it has. Many of them simply dont know how to pilot the champion that well for example, or need to look at/ remind themselves what their Q does before the press it. If an opponent has even minimal experience with the game or has prior moba experience, they are going to simply be better than someone else who’s coming in cold. This is how the game works, it is not a casual ‘pick up and play’ type game for initiates and it is not forgiving out of the gate.

This is the nature of competition and it is experience based and it is skill/talent based.\\n\\n\\nC.

She seems mostly to be an auto-attack based champion, with one single damaging skill that is a straight-line projectile, but you have to bounce backwards, which might take some time to get used to but the principle is simple. She has many many blinks, but they are still fairly standard blinks. What\\'s weird is that the video does not show her incorporating her warp hole into her fights at all, the one with Aur doesn\\'t count, it\\'s like she already has so many blinks that she doesn\\'t need an extra blink so it actually seems to be a superfluous ability at this point. And she has a fairly long range CC set up, which again goes in a straight line and sets up a zone. By and large these abilities don\\'t seem to be in any sense mechanically complicated. It is mainly her ability to steal summoner spells and hence flash multiple times with very little cooldown in between (the fight against Taric + Jinx seems to indicate an at most 1 second cooldown, as opposed to Kassadin 6/4/2 for example) that makes her more \"complicated\" than she actually is.

Almost all champions listed here are, once they got hit by CC, sentenced to death. So, isn't this just overkilling them somehow since the suggested idea requires you to still land the CC in the first place? Also, this creates a balance issue, as targeted CC's value would skyrocket. It's already a valuable asset, but just imagine it with this sort of mechanic implemented. Not to mention, targeted abilities are also not really fun to play against, either. It looks like this concept would be a stopgap measure against the mobility creep.\\n\\nWhile I get the general idea, I think we are essentially punishing a mobile champion here for making use of his kit, when the actual punishment would be the time window in which you can punish the enemy champion directly. This would make mobile champions really, really difficult to balance, as their power curve would swing around wildly. \\n\\nMoreover, I don't think we can group all these champions up and talk about them together. The mobility each have show different traits. And my opinion might be unpopular, but I do think it's actually fair that they have the 1v1 decision making power. If we go with the Brand vs Ahri matchup, for example, the 1v1 laning phase is the only time where Ahri will be in complete control. At any 2v2 and onwards skirmish or full teamfight, Brand will bring more damage and zoning power to his team compared to Ahri. I believe this is the reason post-DFG Ahri has always been in a good health state, and by good health, I mean you can just tune the numbers accordingly and keep her balance proper.

Also, nobody knows what he's truly capable of, many people tend to mess up his passive bar badly, and when it's up he's way better than Aatrox could ever imagine before the rework. \\n\\nPeople say his passive is bad because you can die before you stack it up. In 90% of these situations old Aatrox would just die twice as it means he either got caught or CC'ed hard enough to not even ult, and it's easy af to time CC for his revive correctly. And, I don't know how bad you have to be to fuck up the passive bar in teamfights, because your ult gives 1 stack per person and has a fairly decent range, hit 3 people with it, use Q and E before or after and from 0 stacks you go to 5 in an instant, stacking it fully up.

With RGlory and other tank items he just runs into the enemy team at super speed with his W and RGlory on, especially if you happen to be on one of his captured spires.    \\n\\nThe benefit to him over like Maokai or something is Maokai has W which is on a decently long cooldown, or Sej\\'s dash being a long cooldown.  If the enemy team peels Mao or Sej away after they\\'ve used their mobility spell, there\\'s not much they can do to get to the back line again.  But Skarner\\'s movespeed lasts like 3 seconds so he will just keep running the back line down while being insanely Tanky, the guy just doesn\\'t die.  The threat of a point and click Skarner ult on an important target and him just consistently running at the back line makes the enemy team focus him a ton which helps his team a lot.\\n\\nI\\'m definitely not saying he\\'s better than Sej or Maokai but I think he\\'s pretty good and his pressure is a guaranteed point and click threat which can be much better than a Sej who ult a the wrong target or misses it.

Skarner is built full tank with no AD right now, but leveling his Q pretty much only makes the AD ratio on it higher.  Either Skarner needs more of a reason to build AD, or his Q needs to be reworked to make sense with a full tank kinda build.  Right now it\\'s just decent for clearing jungle and spamming for that extra 20 AoE damage against enemies oh boy.

At that time, Lee Sin\\'s R only had 70s CD, so if we picked both of those champs, we would won any fight\\n\\nWhen GAM first picked Gragas several times and beat SuperMassive, their sp aka Dumbledoge analyzed that despite of their losing, they thought that your Gragas were nothing special\\n\\nYou, since the one who didn\\'t know how to play Gragas, base on what that ppl call you as the best Gragas?

It\\'s definitely not going to be G2 or Fnatic, and Misfits is unlikely as well. Schalke 04 is 100% not it either. That leaves us with five teams.\\n\\nAccording to people behind the scenes, with franchising coming in 2019 some teams are running on borrowed time since they don\\'t have the necessary financial resources. H2k might be people\\'s first guess since they said teams needed 850K per year from Riot in order to be viable, but contrary to popular belief H2k\\'s ownership is actually pretty affluent. They have the financial resources to opt into franchising in the NA LCS like the other four did, they just chose not to. Don\\'t mistake the hesitation to keep incurring massive losses with the lack of financial resources. H2k asked for 850K, Riot gave them 500K. With franchising coming and Riot\\'s compromise they might choose to stay, or still sell their spot. That\\'s up in the air.\\n\\nUoL is one of the financially weakest teams in the entire League and they just lost their core players. They\\'re going to have a hard time.

So that suggests they\\'re at least intending to stay for the 2018 season.\\n\\nThat leaves us with Giants, Roccat, and Vitality. Vitality has VC-ownership so they\\'re definitely not going to sell their spot out of necessity.

Question is if it\\'s still worth it for them, since they joined the scene when owning a team was a lot less resource intensive. That leaves us with the last team, and I wonder why nobody ever mentions them: Giants. Despite their longevity, Giants is one of the old dogs created in a time where all you needed to have an esports team was put five guys together.

I think, having been a part of the community since beta, having been there for all of the ins and outs, and survived until now with the features the game is still missing, that I\\'ve earned the right to have an honest look at it without being called out as a non-existant fanboy.\\n\\nNothing I\\'ve said is wrong, shit that\\'s \"already in the game\" needs work, and everything else you\\'ve said is either irrelevant--as per Blizzard responding to this shit, when they said more than a year ago that hero trading was coming \"soon\"--or a personal opinion, which is pretty much also irrelevant since I listed off a string of factually absent or neglected parts of the game. Such as the front page post I mentioned about the replay issue *that was posted today*. But those don\\'t happen anymore, do they?\\n\\nOverall, your post length and concise summary was a welcome change from the typical shit-throwing I put up with most of the time, but your tone, from every sneering reference to one of many other games I play to your specifically bolded sections designed to \"defeat me\" and repel me from this game are childish and unnecessary. If you\\'d even read my original post with anything but a contemptuous air, you\\'d have noticed that I said HotS needs these things to thrive and that is and will always be the case; people play HotS in large because it\\'s not like any other game, but it\\'s still a MOBA, and *millions* more people play and love league of Legends every single day because of many things is does well. Similarly, there are things that DotA does, and that Smite does, and that HoN does, and Heroes of the Storm taking a page or two or just a phrase from these other games if it\\'s a good choice isn\\'t a bad idea just because they\\'re coming from other games. You aren\\'t currently shitting on Heroes for having minions, lanes, towers, bases, mages, experience, a minimap, lootboxes, right-click movement, skins, a ranked mode, replays, jungle camps, recalling, or map objectives, and these are all things League also has. For a reason. And acting like I didn\\'t specifically mention any of these things in complete reference to making HotS do better as a game and gain even more players is just asinine. Why make a problem that wasn\\'t there just so you can call me out for it?\\n\\nI might have also leaned on how vital some of these are, but it wasn\\'t something I was planning on driving into the ground. Right now, as someone with an internet that makes him suffer *tremendously* long reconnect times on those rare occasions where it comes up--robbing sometimes near ten minutes of my life away as I struggle to rejoin the team that now plans on reporting me as they sail to a usually easy loss with a man down--that\\'s a major point for me. And as someone who hates praying that the first player on our team who gets to pick in draft also happens to be good with one of the top two or three pick and ban characters in the game, trading is pretty much what I want most in HotS right now.

The common discourse in current day Literature is the influences of a writer mean significantly less than the meaning derived from a reader.\\n\\nThe only text I can think of as a good example is 1984. Some would argue that seeing since Orwell fought in the Spanish Civil War (Homage to Catalonia), and had vast experiences of his own (can\\'t quite remember well enough...), would imply that the ONE and ONLY meaning of that book is a warning against totalitarian regimes and so on; or in other words, that the things Orwell was thinking at the time of writing. What death of the author implies, is that the historical context, his personal life, and so on, actually mean very little in determining the true meaning of his text (hint: it\\'s whatever meaning you, as a reader got from it).\\n\\nThe issue with putting the author on a pedestal is that it assumes a text is \"autonomous\", which is completely untrue. The idea that a text is \"an island\" (self-contained, exist in a void...), is greatly flawed. Because this postulates that an author\\'s influences (literary speaking) have no bearing. When in reality, all texts are very closely related (that\\'s the idea of intertextuality). The shift from the author being the \"end-all, be-all\" decider of what a text really means, is not really a valid view anymore. Some would argue otherwise, but the arguments against it are quite compelling, at least in my opinion.\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s more interesting in seeing that ways that a reader responds to a text. That is, what connections and associations does a reader derive from a work. \\n\\nI suppose you\\'re right in saying that an author\\'s personal life shouldn\\'t detract from the perceived quality of their work. However, in the case of \"Death of the Author\", it places emphasis on what meaning a reader gets from a text, rather than the meaning intended by the author. And in this case, you\\'re misinterpreting it as conflating quality of character to quality of text. \\n\\nSo in summation, what meaning is really derived from these guys works? Not a whole lot. Am I allowed to avoid content by someone who I see, as amoral and deplorable? Absolutely. Am I avoiding their content because I disagree with their world view? No, I dislike them as people. But then again, you may say \"avoiding them because you don\\'t like them is just as dumb...\", not really. \\n\\nIf I found out my favourite musician, or author was a horrible person, I would stop supporting their content. Especially if they try and shut-out aspiring content creators. It\\'s like they\\'re trying to hold a monopoly on content, and colluded with each other. It takes a real horrible person to try diminish the creative works of others for their own personal gain. But hey, you can still enjoy someone\\'s work even if they are a bad person. For me, I don\\'t like divulging in content made by what I consider scum-bags. But that\\'s not to say their content is bad, or that I\\'m judging their work from their personal life, but rather I do not wish to support their behaviour. I see it like the whole EA fiasco that\\'s going on; consistently bad acts should not be met with praise. Make them atone for what they\\'ve done.\\n\\nInterpretation != objective analysis (good, bad etc.) through indicators such as (are they a good person, do their world-views align with my own...?)\\n\\nRather Interpretation == subjective analysis (what does this mean to me?).\\n\\nBut hey, this is just my opinion.\\n ', 'leagueoflegends', 0), ('/r/leagueoflegends/comments/7cxmky/imaqtpie_witnesses_evolved_bm/dpuqgoc/', \"Does this mean I can still like Ender's Game even though Orson Scott Card is a terrible excuse for a human being?\", 'leagueoflegends', 0), ('/r/leagueoflegends/comments/7cxmky/imaqtpie_witnesses_evolved_bm/dpumtjz/', \"You have to draw the line sometimes though.

Only one champion/monster can have stacks at any time.  \\n- Q=Vine Whip (ranged)  \\n- W=Wrap (can activate as AA or Q hits to root for a short time)  \\n- E=Growl (AOE enemy damage decreased by % for X seconds)  \\n- R=either Petal Dance (AOE damage followed by a brief CD where abilities cannot be used) or Solar Beam (think Vel'koz ult with damage & small heal for allies)\\n\\n**Charizard**: Melee AA, AP based.  \\n- Q=Flamestrike (short-ish ranged skillshot, damages enemies in a line and sets them ablaze [Brand Q + Ezreal E, but shorter])  \\n- W=Wing Attack (dash through target, dealing damage to all enemies passed through)  \\n- E=Fire Spin (Line of fire spins around Charizard 3 times, damaging all enemies. Refreshes [does not set] ablaze. Ablaze enemies hit by Fire Spin are feared for <time>.)  \\n- R=Inferno (After brief channel, set area around Charizard on fire. Enemies take AP damage every half second. Ablaze champions take true damage on the first tick.)\\n\\n**Blastoise**: Short ranged AA (water cannons), tank/AP based. AAs vs. champions with a Pool Party skin equipped do 50% damage.  \\n- Q=Bubblebeam (Ziggs zone ability, but in a line)  \\n- W=Iron Defense (increase Armor/MR passively, activate to reflect damage for a short amount of time)  \\n- E=Shell Attack (withdraws into shell, dashes in a line, will briefly knock up/back the first champion/large monster hit [Rammus Q effect])  \\n- R=Hydro Pump (shoots out large wall of water, knocking enemies aside [Taliyah wall] and creating an impassable wall wide enough that enemies cannot flash over)\\n\\n**Pikachu**: Ranged AA, AP based. AAs apply 1 mark of Static Charge to a target, stacking up to 3 times  \\n- Q=Thunderbolt (short-range targeted ability. Hitting enemy with Static Charge will additionally deal 50% damage to nearby enemies, range increased by number of stacks. Can chain if jump hits another enemy with Static Charge)  \\n- W=Thunder Wave (channel electricity on an area. If in area for <time>, become stunned for a moment. Stunning enemy with Static Charge deals a burst of damage. Damage and stun length increased by number of stacks of Static Charge)  \\n- E=Quick Attack (dash to target area, do a small amount of damage. 1/1/2/2/3 charges on a short cooldown)  \\n- R=Thunder (call down pillar of electricity on your location. Nearby enemies take damage, are silenced for .1 seconds, and gain 1 stack of Static Charge)\\n\\nAdditionally, you could set it up so certain Pokémon (Venusaur, in this example) deal extra damage to certain champs (Malphite), less damage to other champs (Brand, Annie), and take more (Brand/Annie) or less (Nami) damage from certain champion's abilities, based on type. Probably way overkill, but hey, it's all in good fun.\\n\\nFeel free to toss more Pokémon ideas on here, I've been working on this since the original post went up.\\n\\n---\\n\\nAlso, please just give us **Invoker** from DOTA 2 already.

She would probably build pure tank with 1 damage item, EX: Mercury Treads, Righteous Glory, Titanic Hydra, Spirit Visage, Thornmail/Randuin's Omen, Gargoyle Stoneplate.

Passive E gives her a bit of sustained damage, but it also synergizes with her passive, adding more damage to her basic attacks, it also helps with last hitting. E is her main source of damage, easily shredding tanks of their defenses for her team to kill.

If opponents have MR higher than 8, it is better to have the Rabadon's than a second pair of Sorceror's shoes.\\n\\nYou are wrong.

The journal this was published in is a well-regarded general interest journal, and so the idea that reviewers and the researchers themselves wouldn't have considered such obvious and straightforward alternative explanations and confounders like age is absurd. The sample size comments that a lot of people have made are also totally misguided conceptually and, hilariously, reveal that they didn't even read past the first couple pages, since the paper actually reports the findings of two separate studies, the latter of which uses extremely large samples from several games. \\n\\nIt's fine if people want to armchair about the topic of the study, but the vast majority of these comments reveal that people haven't read the paper (fair) and/or that they have no formal training in causal inference and statistics (also fair, this is a subreddit not a grad school seminar). There is not a single comment here that constitutes a serious criticism of the article's findings. \\n\\n**tl;dr: armchair redditors that don't do statistics and didn't read the paper are saying things that make no sense.**\\n\\nEDIT: A lot of people are harping on the sample size issues. This is a power problem and decreases the likelihood of finding a significant correlation, it doesn't make the study invalid. Most research in modern cognitive psych is based on small samples of college students. There is nothing inherently problematic about small, unrepresentative samples from an inferential perspective. It merely limits the external validity of the findings and makes it less likely that a significant effect is detected. \\n\\nThe extent to which these results would hold in a broader population is an important question but doesn't pose a problem for detecting a correlation in the sample these researchers are working with. Moreover, Study 2 uses a clever design to test an empirical implication of the higher IQ -> higher rank hypothesis for a much larger, representative sample and finds evidence consistent with this hypothesis. Equally as important, the FPS findings show that this relationship does not exist where we would probably not expect it to. This is a kind of placebo test in which you look at the effect of a treatment on an outcome for which you would expect a null finding and seems to me (although I haven't read the paper too closely) quite persuasive. The sample size for Study 2 is enormous (the League sample alone is 400,000) and appears to be a random draw from the ranked populations on the regions and games they analyze. \\n\\n\\n\\n\", 'leagueoflegends', 0), ('/r/leagueoflegends/comments/7ddbcr/study_finds_link_between_high_lol_rank_and/dpwypyg/', 'StUdY fInDs LiNk BeTwEeN hIgH LoL rAnK aNd InTeLlIgEnCe', 'leagueoflegends', 0), ('/r/leagueoflegends/comments/7ddbcr/study_finds_link_between_high_lol_rank_and/dpwx9ck/', '200 IQ Tyler1', 'leagueoflegends', 0), ('/r/leagueoflegends/comments/7ddbcr/study_finds_link_between_high_lol_rank_and/dpx5z6e/', \"But the funny thing is some of my most successful friends irl are bronze while my friends who are diamond just spend time playing the game for hours instead of investing in their real life.

Or to put it in League terms, being knowledgeable means being a top laner and knowing it takes ~30 seconds to get back to lane and that you can all-in the enemy top and win handily, while being intelligent means seeing the jungler is bot side and timing it out so you jump them from the brush between their turrets.\", 'leagueoflegends', 0), ('/r/leagueoflegends/comments/7ddbcr/study_finds_link_between_high_lol_rank_and/dpxji58/', 'Well for one thing, given that results are statistically significant, the ratio of sample size to population size is irrelevant unless the sample size is large enough that it is close to the population size, in which case a correction needs to be made when computing the standard error.

The hope with large datasets such as these is that the huge number of participants more than compensates for the increase in noise caused by the sampling methods.

However, only the Chosen one can spin outside of a starfighter. Palpatine tried spinning, but he lost (but this was intentional, as losing gave him the emotional high ground when Anakin arrived). The reason for this is that spinning provides a yin-yang approach (based in Eastern philosophy on balance), giving the spinner the high ground from above and below. This is why Obi-Wan was so emotional after defeating Vader on Mustafar; he expected to lose the high ground to the spin, but Anakin failed to maintain balance in the universe, symbolic of his fall to the dark side.\\n\\nAnakin doesn't hate sand for the reasons he told Padme; all Jedi hate sand, as the battlefield can rapidly change between low and high ground.

If you kill your opponent and make him lose 2 waves on xp and cs, it's much more worth than a few cs. Ofcourse: cs'ing is your main source of income. But killing the enemy AT THE RIGHT TIMING is very important. As a jungler, I often look which lane pushes in with a shitload of cs. I try to dive that lane or try to zone them away from the cs. If you can get your enemy's laners lose 1,5 wave, often your laners can use that to build up a lead which can result into a good freeze.\\n\\n(I'm not maining a certain role, so I know every role's macro pretty good, so that's where my advise comes from)\\n\\nTalking about freezing: as a jungler it's your duty to help break enemy freezes. F.E. the enemy toplaner has a perfect freeze: ward the toplane, go top just to push it out, which will lead in the minions being under your toplaner's turret in a minute or so. An addition to this: as a jungler, always help pushing out the lane where you just got a kill (except when your teammate(s) aren't planning on going B). This way your laner builds up a huge lead (mentioned before)\\n\\nMy last jungle-tip: not only you should gank to gain a lead, gank to tilt. Tilt is your friend if you know how to use it. When killing the toplaner level 3, go take scuttle crab, watch them teleport to a Minion and kill them.

Let them settle in and get comfortable in their new environment with their new teammates. This seems as if they think Korea is some hyperbolic time chamber that is the place you go if you want to speed up progression... when in reality you need to understand what bootcamping in Korea can do for you and have clear reasons/goals for going. \\n\\nSo thinking of that, what can you accomplish in Korea right now that you can't in NA? You get better ping for solo q? Only makes sense to me if they want to try out some Korean prospects or if a majority of the other NA teams are planning on going as well. \\n\\nScrim wise, they need to be just focusing on learning how to play together. They need to start agreeing on basics to the game, identifying weaknesses, determining their communication structure, and just learning each others tendencies and styles. None of that requires Korea. There will be plenty of teams in NA looking to scrim with their new rosters. You don't need to play against higher level teams right now to accomplish those goals. If anything, getting shit stomped in scrims will lower morale and confidence and make it really hard to work on the basics. In Korea you have to worry about accommodations, finding scrim partners with limited connections, living out of a suitcase, finding healthy food (much harder on the go and without being familiar with the area/language), etc. \\n\\nIt is also beneficial, especially for a new team, to start developing relationships with good scrim partners. See which teams look the best or provide the best practice for your team. Go to Korea and all the other teams are filling their future scrim slots and developing relationships with teams they want to use as scrim partners throughout the season. As a new team, Optic may already have a tougher time getting scrim partners especially if their roster isn't seen as strong, so this may hurt their ability to get scrims even more. \", 'leagueoflegends', 0), ('/r/leagueoflegends/comments/7esq3h/zaboutine_romain_bigeards_interview_about_their/dq7dksb/', \"I'll give you a proper translation. With formatting! I'm skipping the part before the actual interview. Might add it later during the day\\n\\n\\n\\n**How did you arrive at OpticGaming?**\\n\\n**Romain Bigeard(RB):** The team received founding from big investors (such as Neil Leibman, boss of Texas Rangers from the MLB) and they were looking for someone to get into League of Legends. They heard good comments about me, my ideas and it got done pretty quickly. 5 days after  having spoken with them via phone for the first time, I was in a plane headed to Riot HQ in order to convince them to choose OpticGaming for a spot among the 10 franchises in the league. My prescence helped their application given that there were about 100 applicants during the first round, still many during the 2nd round and Riot wanted to make sure that every team had at least 1 individual who truly knew LoL.\\n\\n**Thomas «Zaboutine» Si-Hassen(Z):** I knew Bercy would be the biggest stage of my career as caster and that it would be difficult to make it bigger despite my love for it. Romain asked me if I would be interested in coaching a LCS team and I said yes without hesitation. Mostly because I've wanted to work with him for a long time : we are of a same mind concerning many subjects and he leaves me completely responsible of the game part\\n\\n\\n\\n**At what point did it become a change of dimension?**\\n\\n**Z:** The change of scale can give you vertigo since we're the 1st generation being thrusted into franchising. Given the partner and investors we have, the presence from the NBA, it's impossible to assess how much visibility will change.  We're with OpTic, who has over 3M twitter followers. Even before having a team in League of Legends, Overwatch or DotA. It truly is a challenge. Its like going from high-school where you thought you were good at maths to pre-college (The french have an intermediary school between high-school and college). You take a seat, thinking you're good at this and after 25 mins you understand that you're no longer playing the same game.\\n\\n**RB:** OpTic is building an empire. Esports, as a whole, has been identified, notably by NBA teams,  as an investment that pays back. There are many players that want to take control of the field and they invest considerable amounts of money to solidify their spot among the 1st ones with a foot on the market. Its a global change and we're lucky enough to be in the front seat. Today, we have the scale of the staples of traditional sports with 7 figures budgets at our disposal. And the market is telling us that its not as big as our adversaries expected it to be. \\n\\n\\n**The transfer period just started, I'm assuming that's priority number one? I'd imagine it's also harder to start from zero when facing TSMs and C9s who have been there for years?**\\n\\n**RB:** It's more work because most teams already have the players but also training facilities and staff... we have a budget, we're placed against the other teams, we gave offers and given the feedback we'll receive we will build our structure. Our objective is to have 5 players before the weekend and we'll go to Korea and we'll be back before the holidays. And the season will begin. We might end up with a less team that is, on paper, less fascinating than those of other orgs but we'll be able to push them to the max.\\n\\n**Z:** We're 100% in. We have a 15man short-list around which we want to build a team. But the real question is: Which players are we going to sign from NA and which player we'll be importing, given that we're bound by the rules that impose 3 locals and 2 imports. We have to build with that.\\n\\n\\n\\n**So, Romain, are you keeping that fantastic touch that made you unique in Europe?**\\n\\n**RB:** I don't know! Becoming the mascot for UOL was the product of many months of work. I'm guessing that in the USA, if you win, you can do whatever you want. If the results are there the attention will turn towards us and if the chance presents itself I'll take it. Will I end up half-naked in the scene? Maybe, maybe not.
