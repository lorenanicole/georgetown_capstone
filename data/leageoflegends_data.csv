Top 3: Tristana, Caitlyn, Kalista.  
Tristana, because I think she scales super well. Tremendous amounts of damage once she gets her double zeal spike. So you can play your utility supports and try to win off that. Or play all-in lanes and look to snowball early. Feels like everything works with her because her kit is very diverse.  
Caitlyn, because she has really good bully potential as well as wave control. Her high range in good player hands is an insane advantage, because you can outrade enemy duo most of the time. It also helps her stay out of danger more easily due to higher range, which is really important factor.  
Kalista, she can by herself win some matchups. Probably the most dominant adc in lane, which is huge pleasure to play with. So many random kills because of unexpected burst made snowball going.  
It's hard to make 3 adc I would hate to play with. Anything with low range kinda sucks. Biggest offender would be Vayne. She has no wave control and very low range. Such a hard champion to be effective with. But I always try to think positive and make most of champion strengths! ",leagueoflegends,0

/r/leagueoflegends/comments/7afws1/got_to_masters_before_season_ends_as_support/dpbajh7/,"You forgot to mention how is your jungler doing, which I find to be the most important teammate for you. He decides which map side has pressure, can you play upwards in lane or you have to play safe. That said, if your jungler is very inactive, you got yourself a hard game ahead where you have to have at least 1 lane to brute force snowballing to simulate pressure on their own. Why pressure is important? Because that's where you have to play around as support with your vision and abilities most of the time when opportunity is right.  
Anyhow to shortly answer your question, most likely you gonna lose unless you roam with jungler and maybe try to invade bot side or stop being even bot and create advantage. If your solo lanes are losing you must have pressure bottom to equalize it and have any chance at winning. It also heavily relies on team composition. Maybe it's expected to lose most of the lanes early to turn the tides later on. This happens in pro play as well.  
Link me your op.gg and I can give you more direct advice.  
  
For your elo I would recommend playing more aggressive to gain advantage on your own. Your skill level of players choke on correct trades and strong positioning A LOT. I really can't give more detailed tips cause I don't know what champs you play.  
  
When it comes to learning, I always look at korean master+ players who play that champ a lot on current or at least previous patch. I look for runes/masteries/items. Then I try to understand why they run that and try to make my own setup and builds while taking in their ideas. Then after trying 10 or so games in rankeds I learn playstyle of champion, weakness and strengths and try to watch replays of them or other pro players in recent patch to see how they play around those things. I try to add their way of playing into my own which is my final step of learning.",leagueoflegends,0

/r/leagueoflegends/comments/7afws1/got_to_masters_before_season_ends_as_support/dpbc7wv/,"Firstly, runes. Not sure why you prefer 0.5% health yellows over flat hp or at least armor. To gain value out of these you would need to stack hp, which comes way later and game might be already decided. Avoid using scaling runes on supports! Flat stats are what you looking for usually. I highly recommend flat hp yellows, in total they give extra 72 hp which is bonkers! For the same reason use flat armor quints, not scaling!!  
When it comes to ability maxing, I don't personally play Taric so I can't give you my own reliable experience input but from what I know, it's similar to Lulu where champion is flexible and you can max what you prefer. From what I played I like maxing E first on Taric because it gives way more damage in lane. It also seems to be more popular choice among other Taric players in Korea. That said, Q max is fine as well as long as you are more passive type of player (which I am against in your elo if you want to climb).  
Build wise, I can't really recommend something because it's very flexible especially after ardent nerfs. I would prefer ardent/redemption first over locket because locket scales of hp and it gives flat resistances so buying it later gives more value than rushing it.  
General climbing tips, stop playing flex. Every flex game means 1 less game in soloQ. Because you play soloQ as support you don't get autofilled so learn something safe on off-role if you really need it but stick to support role as much as possible and dodge if you need. Don't be afraid to dodge couple of times, 13LP loss from couple dodges per day is nothing compared to mmr and bigger LP loss.",leagueoflegends,0

/r/leagueoflegends/comments/7ag2r5/whats_up_with_the_amount_of_smurfs/dp9w8w2/,"A. As others have said, actual smurfs are relatively reliably picked out of the noob queue and put into their own (maybe around level 7-10ish) as that skill level becomes apparent to the system. This will get better as you level and as time goes on. League requires a base amount of data to work with for you and it takes maybe 20-30+ games to get that base data from your play over time.


B. People who are just picking up this game often do not realize what a tremendous learning curve it has. Many of them simply dont know how to pilot the champion that well for example, or need to look at/ remind themselves what their Q does before the press it. If an opponent has even minimal experience with the game or has prior moba experience, they are going to simply be better than someone else who’s coming in cold. This is how the game works, it is not a casual ‘pick up and play’ type game for initiates and it is not forgiving out of the gate. Think about it like a sport- if someone else played rugby in grade school and now they’re on your university football team, they’re going to simple know more and play better. This is the nature of competition and it is experience based and it is skill/talent based.


C. Putting these together - I would start by playing bot games and really starting to build your experience base in a safe environment. PvP modes are for those who feel comfortable with the base operations and strategies of the game, and will likely be frustrating to learn the foundations of the game on in an environment where smurfs exist. You can earn xp in bot games and level to 30 there, start with that and really learn the fundamentals well in a healthier environment.",leagueoflegends,0

You often get through the filter, just cause you actually try to play support. Thats just way more efficient than everything you see from new players. Perhaps sticking to carry roles only will put you back with the new players. If not, I assume the system just recognizes you as a pretty good player.

Its not fun, its not balanced (had level 15 games vs a diamond Kha jungle) and it gives little Exp per minute compared to bot games. 

I don't think smurfs are an issue though. Maybe they are a little stupid to play against on low levels, but as soon as you play some normals you will rarely see a smurf. In addition to that most people ""smurfing"" are litterally bronze trashbags thinking the reason they are bronze is that something went wrong with their MMR. Its just untrue. Don't get scared of them. Really most smurfs are just as bad as you are. 

I don't think any change is needed from riots side, except maybe a suggested leveling path for new player (play bot games for quite a while). New players need to learn a lot when they start the game and I just think a Normal game isn't the correct way to learn lasthitting, jungle clearing or just how a champion works. 

TL;DR - Don't play normals when you are new to the game, as you should have a lot of stuff you need to learn and you can learn them from bot games. Also bot games give more exp/minute (because you can end faster) ",leagueoflegends,0

/r/leagueoflegends/comments/7ag2r5/whats_up_with_the_amount_of_smurfs/dpa456x/,"Hey there, I'm pretty new myself (started playing last week) and I experienced the same thing. A lot of games were just not fun because most times the game was over after about 13-20 mins because there was one guy (or multiple in a party) who kept wrecking the other team. 

At that time I wasn't sure what my playtyle is, too so 90% of my pvp games ended about 1-3/15+/3. It wasn't really fun seeing the death-screen all of the time and the only reason I kept playing was that a friend of mine I was on Discord with kept telling me to not care about it. I was a tanky top laner maining darius at that time.

Luckily I got a riven skin out of my first crate and after looking at her stats (I always thought I dealt too little dmg for my likes) I saved up and bought her. The difference was insane, I felt much more confident and so my first game went down 13/7/20 despite me having no clue about items or the lane meta. You know, I've seen riven before and I gotta say I really like her appearance, her moves and her backstory. Getting to play her was just awesome. 

After some more games - I seemed to play worse again, getting a ton of deaths and losses I decided after seeing her completely wreck my games multiple times to get ashe. Ashe isn't too expensive and imho she's really beginner-friendly. 

My last game (normal, 20/7/32) was damn close. I started bot lane with an awesome support sona and I just kept getting kills, once 5 in a row. Unfortunately we lost but it was a great experience nevertheless.

I still adore riven and I'll try to master her but right now (~7 games, I won 5. Surprisingly I didnt see any smurfs) it seems like I'm better off with ashe.

Although the Official Languages Act is not the only piece of federal language law, it is the legislative keystone of Canada's official bilingualism. It was substantially amended in 1988.

We can't promote that type of behavior here at school so it's a no from me""

I asked about using SSB and he redid the search and found it to be E for everyone and said it was okay. We played Super Smash Brothers Melee which was actually also T for Teen but his search showed SSB4 which was rated E.

Moral of the story... be actually considerate when you look at these things or it'll come back to bite you right in your arse anyway. ~~That vice principal wasn't like at all by anyone anyway, it's obvious why.~~

her body model is in line to new champions like ekko, and she is not as much cartoony to me as just wacky and wimsical

i also don't like that one but i don't see it as cartoony but rather dead, artificial and poorly done.

im not saying it doesn't but he is the silliest by far out off all champions and will still be after Zoe is released

>  Not to mention how all Yordle look cartoony. That's their trait.

exept for kled yeah most of them are and i like that.

she is most likely not (normal) human anymore/never was even if she resembles one.

> That clashes with everything we've had so far.

like every 3-4 we have relesed from time to time. LoL world is one where people with advanced guns fight little sentinent rodents, other people in medieval armors with swords, old egiptian god lookalikes, vikings, mages, android scientists with russian accent, fox demon girl and other wierd shit. Everything crashes here and thats fun at least for me.

> I'm also not happy about her being a child. Annie is already league's child. Now she lost her identity because little girl with fire and burning bear is far less impressive, than...what Zoe is.

If being a child is only thing that hold her identity unique in the game then it may be time for a rework. Also it was a matter of time till we get at least one more kid in, ""unfortunate"" for Annies fragile identity it had to be a girl",leagueoflegends,0

It seems pretty clear from the video what her attack pattern is going to be like. She seems mostly to be an auto-attack based champion, with one single damaging skill that is a straight-line projectile, but you have to bounce backwards, which might take some time to get used to but the principle is simple. She has many many blinks, but they are still fairly standard blinks. What's weird is that the video does not show her incorporating her warp hole into her fights at all, the one with Aur doesn't count, it's like she already has so many blinks that she doesn't need an extra blink so it actually seems to be a superfluous ability at this point. And she has a fairly long range CC set up, which again goes in a straight line and sets up a zone. By and large these abilities don't seem to be in any sense mechanically complicated. It is mainly her ability to steal summoner spells and hence flash multiple times with very little cooldown in between (the fight against Taric + Jinx seems to indicate an at most 1 second cooldown, as opposed to Kassadin 6/4/2 for example) that makes her more ""complicated"" than she actually is.

Trynd's #1 hard counter, and Trynd mains don't know it either. They try to opt into aggro level 1, level 2 trades and don't understand that they lose.

Then they try to fight you at level 6 and you eat them during their ult duration... then they're so far out of the game it doesn't matter.

Camille is kind of shitty for Tahm, because she has such good disengage against him with her hook shot. Problem is that most Camilles try to be aggro and hook shot into Tahm, and then they have to kill him or die. Nice outplay is when he gets his 3 passive stacks on you, you can ult a tongue lash or a devour to dodge it and maybe it puts you over the edge in the fight. Tahm is going to try to tongue lash you or devour you every time he applies the 3rd stack, particularly if he has a clear shot, so you can play around that and force him to be patient. Ideally you go for short trades with him, and you hook shot or kite out when you're 2/3 stacks. Particularly if you rush ravenous, you're golden. Perma-push on him, and it's hard for him to match you--even if he gets a tiamat or Bami's. Then 4-5 short trades with lifesteal for you and none for him, you'll win all ins and take towers vs. even if you die, he has zero tower taking potential.

9-1-1, also written 911, is an emergency telephone number for the North American Numbering Plan (NANP), one of eight N11 codes. Like other emergency numbers around the world, this number is intended for use in emergency circumstances only, and using it for any other purpose (such as making false or prank calls) is a crime in certain jurisdictions.

In over 98% of locations in the United States and Canada, dialing ""9-1-1"" from any telephone will link the caller to an emergency dispatch office—called a public-safety answering point (PSAP) by the telecom industry—which can send emergency responders to the caller's location in an emergency. In approximately 96 percent of the U.S., the enhanced 9-1-1 system automatically pairs caller numbers with a physical address.

/r/leagueoflegends/comments/7ajxup/new_rune_idea_i_call_it_sit_the_fuck_down/dpb34x1/,"An interesting idea, but I just don't get the point. Almost all champions listed here are, once they got hit by CC, sentenced to death. So, isn't this just overkilling them somehow since the suggested idea requires you to still land the CC in the first place? Also, this creates a balance issue, as targeted CC's value would skyrocket. It's already a valuable asset, but just imagine it with this sort of mechanic implemented. Not to mention, targeted abilities are also not really fun to play against, either. It looks like this concept would be a stopgap measure against the mobility creep.

While I get the general idea, I think we are essentially punishing a mobile champion here for making use of his kit, when the actual punishment would be the time window in which you can punish the enemy champion directly. This would make mobile champions really, really difficult to balance, as their power curve would swing around wildly. 

Moreover, I don't think we can group all these champions up and talk about them together. The mobility each have show different traits. And my opinion might be unpopular, but I do think it's actually fair that they have the 1v1 decision making power. If we go with the Brand vs Ahri matchup, for example, the 1v1 laning phase is the only time where Ahri will be in complete control. At any 2v2 and onwards skirmish or full teamfight, Brand will bring more damage and zoning power to his team compared to Ahri. I believe this is the reason post-DFG Ahri has always been in a good health state, and by good health, I mean you can just tune the numbers accordingly and keep her balance proper. Setting Ahri as an example, mobile champions should have their strengths and weaknesses accentuated better, so that  it doesn't feel as frustrating to play around their mobility.",leagueoflegends,0

The ahri has to try and dash around the fking galio who has his shield of Durand enabled and the sejuani who is a fking boar eating your charm and taking negative damage. Is getting up close and personal in a team fight where one wrong move can get you insta killed not risk enough?

/r/leagueoflegends/comments/7ajxup/new_rune_idea_i_call_it_sit_the_fuck_down/dpbbzhl/,"Well, the champions you named are all Assassins. Of course they're making all the ""decisions"" if you're playing (in your example) Brand. You're a squishy backliner with a bunch of frontloaded / AoE nukes with the addition of an awesome AoE multichaining high %hp damage passive. It is not your place to be taking fights on the ready with these mobile champions. They, in theory with their high tier mobility, counter you.

Those champions all lack something your champion specializes in though. Wave clear and area control. Sure, and Ahri can clear casters and melees with a Q for casters and some autos and another Q to match your clear, but that's no where close to what she wants to be doing with someone who will eventually one shot her entire team.

Your goals are fundamentally opposite of hers (or any Assassin) and it's important both champions are playing around this. Undermining this basic principle with goofy new runes just doesn't sit well with me. It feels lazy and unwarranted.

As for supportive champions like Rakan, most can only pull off his good combos after a bit of experience and knowledge, and with that comes more knowledgable opponents. In an ideal world we know when Rakan's flash is up and if he's not there on the map. These indicators alone are solid reads on where is safe and where is dangerous, no matter how far of a distance he can travel in a second.

Truthfully, instead of runes being a crutch I'd like to see more items in the game that can counteract some ""frustrating"" champions. Something as simple as Tabis can change entire metas - but just for a moment imagine other items being able to be built on ADC or Mids that prevent burst damae.

I believe mant possibilities are possible in both roles besides ""full damage and zhonas / QSS + ninja Tabisl,"" they just haven't been brought any light due to the imense efficiency of standard ADC builds.",leagueoflegends,0

Even if this were to be done to be balanced it'd have to have some major tweaks; Like instead of increasing CC duration just say cut tenacity in half or something? Then give it a minute cooldown or something because otherwise this literally guts 95% of the high skill champions from the game... 

Do remember mobile champions already lose tons of base stats and such anyway... Like compare Darius to say Yasuo  they get like +30 Base AD ALONE which realize is 3 LONG SWORDS/ 1050G... That's from extra AD alone, he gets +370HP == +962 Gold... +15 Armor ==+300 GOLD... +15 MR==+300 GOLD...

Litteraly Yasuo's mobility costs him 2600Gold!  Btw if Yasuo's passive gives him 50% 'free crit' (when it really doesn't it's more like BOGO) then that's 2000G ... Yasuo even with his ""STUPID OP DOUBLE CRIT PASSIVE"" is still -600 Gold from Darius in stats and remember Yasuo is a Skirmisher category.

A less messy way to write that:

This ability applies the ""Weakened"" status effect to an enemy champion when hit. Weakened can stack up to [Z] times for each Dash, Blink, or Flash the afflicted target used, for up to [W] seconds. The next Movement Impairing ability that affects a Weakened champion has its duration increased [X]% per stack, up to a maximum of [XX%].

Like what specific champions do you feel are out of line mobility wise? Assassins aren't in a great spot, toplane carries aren't dominating, and in fact, most of them struggle to navigate teamfights as well as they should be able to, due to the abundance of CCs. Most of them are already banished to splitpushing and this would just make it even harder for them to group and fight with their team.

If this were to be implemented I assume you meant it as a tank mastery or possibly for supports which is the only thing that makes sense to me, meaning tanks would have yet another way to deal with carries in lane which isn't really an issue for them as long as bramble vest exists, or the keystone would take effect in later teamfights where they are already ineffective. It's basically just hitting them where they are weakest and keeping what makes them frustrating to play against i.e. playing a skillshot reliant mage against Yasuo, or being an ADC trying to escape from a Zed trying to do what he was designed to do.

I'm sorry, what exactly is stopping champ X from fighting Ahri and Yasuo? Yasuos dash is targeted so getting away from your opponent towards your own tower isn't all that easy, more importantly however this is not HotS. *Everyone* will kill creeps. Yasuo is a melee champion, fight him when he walks up to get the gold.

It's like saying I cannot possibly decide to fight GP cause every time I try he shoots his barrel, runs away as if he had 3 boots and cleanses my CC in the process. Is that something you will hear in Bronze allchat by people who get stomped by GP? Yes. Is it complete bullshit? Yes.

Like I'm sorry, but as long as you don't permanently push waves into Yasuo's or Ahri's turret before leaving those creeps under the turret uncontested, you will find oppertunities to fight those champions. And I'm mostly talking about midlane right now lol, imagine toplane, 85% of all toplane champs are able to fight Yasuo whenever they want to.

/r/leagueoflegends/comments/7ak0mu/is_there_a_more_forgotten_champion_than_volibear/dpaq81f/,"I heavily disagree. Aatrox is super strong if played correctly in low-to-mid elo in both top and jungle, and you can still play him quite effectively in Diamond. For first, people don't know what to build and either go off tank, which is horrible, full tank which is even worse, or full damage, also bad. He's the best with 2 defensive items and something semi defensive thrown in like GA, Maw or Black Cleaver. Also, nobody knows what he's truly capable of, many people tend to mess up his passive bar badly, and when it's up he's way better than Aatrox could ever imagine before the rework. 

People say his passive is bad because you can die before you stack it up. In 90% of these situations old Aatrox would just die twice as it means he either got caught or CC'ed hard enough to not even ult, and it's easy af to time CC for his revive correctly. And, I don't know how bad you have to be to fuck up the passive bar in teamfights, because your ult gives 1 stack per person and has a fairly decent range, hit 3 people with it, use Q and E before or after and from 0 stacks you go to 5 in an instant, stacking it fully up. I'm actually super happy for what Riot did to Aatrox because his previous iteration was completely unplayable after Sated Devourer removal (and even then he was just a worse Yi, Xin or Jax).

/r/leagueoflegends/comments/7ak0mu/is_there_a_more_forgotten_champion_than_volibear/dpb5yc2/,"Shame too, I think Skarner is pretty decent for soloqueue.  I played him a bit as a secondary to Warwick when I was in high plat climbing to diamond and was pretty successful on him.  When built full tank he's kind of a big threat to the enemy team in teamfights.  With RGlory and other tank items he just runs into the enemy team at super speed with his W and RGlory on, especially if you happen to be on one of his captured spires.    

The benefit to him over like Maokai or something is Maokai has W which is on a decently long cooldown, or Sej's dash being a long cooldown.  If the enemy team peels Mao or Sej away after they've used their mobility spell, there's not much they can do to get to the back line again.  But Skarner's movespeed lasts like 3 seconds so he will just keep running the back line down while being insanely Tanky, the guy just doesn't die.  The threat of a point and click Skarner ult on an important target and him just consistently running at the back line makes the enemy team focus him a ton which helps his team a lot.

I'm definitely not saying he's better than Sej or Maokai but I think he's pretty good and his pressure is a guaranteed point and click threat which can be much better than a Sej who ult a the wrong target or misses it.  And if Skarner grabs a priority target they're probably dead.  He's a persistent threat.

And side note, whenever Skarner is brought up people talk about his spire gimmick.  ""It's too much of a gimmick, remove spires, balance him other ways"".  I think his spires are a cool mechanic though, they help his clear immensely because he has zero mana problems on them, they're really fun to fight on, and they add another team element to the game.  

If anything his Q needs a rework.  Skarner is built full tank with no AD right now, but leveling his Q pretty much only makes the AD ratio on it higher.  Either Skarner needs more of a reason to build AD, or his Q needs to be reworked to make sense with a full tank kinda build.  Right now it's just decent for clearing jungle and spamming for that extra 20 AoE damage against enemies oh boy.  It also has some weird ass power up mechanic where after you use it once it gets more powerful the 2nd time which I see zero purpose in because it doesn't make any difference when it's powered up. Maybe it does like 10 extra damage before armor or whatever lmao.",leagueoflegends,0

Either you do really well and have 12 mark by 20min mark and 3 hit most squishies , Or you get counter jungle by Lee sin/kha and other duelists and have 2 marks at 25min.

A good QOL change that would do the trick for kindred early is giving less vision to the enemy jungler/team for the first few marks.

Enemies are not able to see marks on the minimap unless they scout it first. Rewarding the enemy team instead of giving them free vision/intel of where your going to be.

Most of the time , if i don't rush my mark after it spawned i just give up on it. Yeah you have your passive to feed you marks however you can get unlucky and your marked target live while everyone else dies in a teamfight.

WOLF - ENEMY MONSTERS: Starting at 2:30, Wolf periodically selects a monster camp within the enemy's jungle based on Lamb's current Marks for 180 seconds, and selects another one 50 seconds after killing a marked monster. 0 stacks is Scuttles on up to buffs at 7 and then just epics at 8+.

My thought was, why not reduce the number of stacks one can get from Wolf's marks (say, to 5-6?), but do what you suggest and double the number that spawn, randomized between the 4 jungle quadrants. This would force both junglers to be more flexible (both on enemy side means more strategy to invade/predict the invade, while both on the Kindred side ...encourages... the invade, which means more fights). However, by reducing the number of stacks, we'd curtail their late game power-farming thing. 


I'm imagining being able to get, say, 2-3 early stacks without needing to be amazing (say: 1 scuttles, 1 on bot krugs, one for an assist on a marked kill 4 minutes in or so), and now Kindred can actually duel things.",leagueoflegends,0

Buff her clear speed, keep her dueling power, nerf her lategame power. Overall it should be a buff, since those 10-17 stacks fantasies with insane range are pretty cool to live out in practice mode, they almost never become a reality in an actual PVP game.

If Riot wants Kindred to hunt their marks to get stronger, fine.

At the moment, you either snowball or pray the game goes 50+ minutes. And good luck snowballing when your only source of strength is posted on the map, deep in enemy territory, for everyone to see. 

I know you can ignore jungle camps and gank the opposite side of the map from the mark, but that game plan is still pretty telegraphed outside of silver :/

Having just a ticking time bomb in the jg just doesn't work and i'm nearly positive that is why Riot doesn't want to buff her because she is either able to survive invades and jungle skirmishes and scales into the late game super hard or she can't and becomes unplayable because she can't gank or provide any pressure.",leagueoflegends,0

/r/leagueoflegends/comments/7aju2w/would_kindred_not_be_more_balanced_if_wolf/dpb80oh/,"and there's the issue with Kindred's mark system. You're absolutely correct. There doesn't seem to be a decent middle ground between OP and *meh*. 

The current mark system is extremely telegraphed, as it has been since release. Kindred is too reliant on it. I think Kindred's early *should* be weak, as they scale well (assuming you get a decent number of marks). However, if you fail to get your early marks the game is over by 30 minutes because outside of your utility, you're useless. Okay, maybe not totally useless but odds are the other team is strong enough to make it feel like you are. 

No other late game jungler suffers as badly from early mistakes, because they can pick up some gold here and there and eventually catch up. Kindred doesn't have the ability to catch up in a single teamfight, at least not the in the same way other champs would benefit from 3 kills or so, because you're only getting 1 mark from the fight and maybe a second from the jg, maybe. 

Maybe I'm just putting too much emphasis on the marks. This is all only the opinion of a mid gold player, so I'm certainly not the best.  

I just think it's silly to make a champion reliant on doing something early-mid game but then make them weak AND extremely predictable. Why bother picking them at that point, you know?

Edit: Also, I'm not saying Kindred needs buffs, or even changes... they've sat around a 50% wr for quite a while, so clearly there isn't any major issue. I just dislike the way marks work.",leagueoflegends,0

The meta doesn’t favor her playstyle, farming and counterjungling aren’t what’s in with junglers and E. In a ganking meta Kindred is outclassed in actual ganking and can’t win 2v2s.

Prior to that, Samsung was still pretty much considered at the same tier as SKT and KT, and was seen as a stylistic mismatch to SKT. This was when people were still doubtful whether LZ were for real or not as they began to rise to the top. Afterwards, LZ kept cementing their status as a top team, while Samsung gradually lost their winning habit and limped through the rest of the split.

Saying ""Thoorin is right, nobody predicted Samsung to achieve much"" would be recency bias. He straight up denied this possibility after last year's final, in which Samsung proved they could dance with the likes of SKT, not after some poor Samsung performance.

Also if you look at SSG in 2016 and SSG 2017 ya its same roster but they play almost like a different team with guy like crown getting his viktor nerfed and struggling to find his new identity in the team and then Ruler evolve from this too aggresive not calculating player to a very good adc (surely the meta helps his style of play)
Also cuvee being even better than last year.

This is an incredibly bad analogy, writing a 10 page paper on why 2+2 could indeed be 5 under certain conditions is exactly what mathematicians could do. The core of maths are axioms, assumptions. When doing anything mathematically, you use a certain amount of axioms. Generally, there is a set of axioms that is considered to be usable and not false. The fact that 2+2=5 is considered false is because of this certain set of axioms but could completely be true under different axioms.

Furthermore, what if someone finds a contradiction in this accepted set of axioms? Applying all the assumptions in such a set could indeed lead to some very obscure situation where suddenly the axioms don't line up with themselves anymore. As a result, 2+2 could indeed be 5.

You might note that 2+2=5 doesn't make any sense intuitively under any set of rules, and you're correct, but that doesn't really matter in mathematics. Mathematics is about applying rules to numbers. These rules don't have to be intuitive. And yes, proving simple addition can take more than 10 pages. Infamously, it took Russell and Whitehead 300+ pages to get to the point where they could prove that 1+1=2. Now if the proof is bullshit, then maybe you could state ""you're not really doing math"", but otherwise it's perfectly math.

I agree.

Actually, in that video, he referenced numerous different games during the season, so I'm going to go ahead and say he did watch the games. As a matter of fact, judging by the episodes of Summoning Insight that I have watched, and I've watched almost all of them, he most definitely did watch that season.


I went and rewatched this video and he said that NRG were favorites because they had expereienced players who matched up better overall vs. Liquid, apart from Altec and Kwonkwon.

You're right. Some people have the game knowledge, but not the mechanics. And vice versa. But again, these are exceptions to the rule. The vast majority of players are not exceptions. Wanna know why? Because statistics. op.gg if you're interested. So what does all of this mean? It means that, generally speaking, you must be high elo to understand the game at a high level. 

Threads like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/7av1do/fw_karsa_heading_to_na/) are a joke. Look at those toxic posts. You've got a bunch of low elo players shitting on pros as if they're qualified to do so. Gee, I wonder why certain pros avoid this subreddit. 

And [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/79jnyk/best_tristana_ult_of_all_time/dp2m5tp/) is proof that most players here are bad. People got upvoted for defending Cody, saying it was an accident (it was not). Then there are guys like me who got downvoted for pointing out how the play was 100% intentional. I even explained step-by-step what he was trying to do, but most players still couldn't see it. The reality is that most players here have poor game knowledge. You're not doing anyone any favors by pretending to be nice.

I am pretty good at this vidya game (unfortunately). I don't play much anymore, but [here's](http://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=fasgf) a practice account I use on occasion. WR would be higher, but I decayed to Gold after a 9-month hiatus. And for some strange reason, I get queued vs dirty duoq abusers more often than I'd like. 

Also, I didn't pull the 99.9% number out of my ass. Players start to get good at Diamond 1, which is top 0.1%. This is from experience, and most high elo players will tell you something similar. Some ex-pros and ex-challenger players are stuck in D1, some even lower than that.

Kkoma is not the exception in e-sports and even more so in traditional sports. If you go through and look at a lot of people actually in the industry, most people on the back-end/support staff for teams are incredibly knowledgeable about the game/sport being played at a very high-end level but very rarely ever played at the top end or can even be considered at the top end for skill with performance. Knowledge, critically thinking, as well as analyzing the specific game/sport can be done without personally being good enough to execute. However, the supporting staff like coaches and analysts can dedicate more time understanding and imparting that knowledge to the actual players which saves a large amount of time for the players who can then focus on actual execution.

However, it is true that the majority of players/audience have no idea what they're talking about. If you follow traditional sports, talking to any sports fan about the sport they watch, their knowledge is generally pretty shallow. However, they'll discuss and enjoy it. They're a part of the community and they should be free to discuss things even if they're completely wrong about the specifics. They might find the correct answer even if their approach to the answer is wrong but you won't know until people actually converse with each other. Even more so, the ""plebs"" discussing things can be important as it creates a vibrant and interesting community. They're the viewers and essentially the reason why the pros even have jobs. If they didn't talk about the games and watched them, there goes the sponsors and any potential for the money to be flowing in. Although fans can be toxic, it's part of competitive events. They're divisive and create tribe mentality. I'd rather have people argue over sports/games over things that are more nefarious in nature.

I'm willing to say that all Riot-sanctioned coaches and analysts are exceptions to the rule (that you have to be high elo to understand the game at a high level). This subset of players all have immense game knowledge. It's the most basic requirement for the job. 

""League personalities."" These are popular players who have egos that far surpass their rank. They talk big. They are unproven. Many players look up to them because they are ""highly ranked"" and they pretend to be enlightened league gurus. Some of these guys offer garbage, hilariously-overpriced coaching services. Some of these guys smurf in low elo all the time and try to pass it off as teaching viewers how to climb (in truth, they don't play on their mains cause they're stuck and they don't want to show that on stream). Obviously, I have no respect for any of these players.

I will translate it for you

Tinikun responsed to Stark: All former top laners for GAM (Ren, Nevan, even you- Stark), I always care for them, I teach them, I blame them, until they left, then I will stop
I blocked Ren, I also blocked you. It means if they're successful or fail, it doesn't matter for me, because everyone has their own way

Since you left team (as I blocked your fb), ppl call you best top, god Stark, best Gragas, blabla,.. Even ppl insulted me, I didn't response anything, because I had said that I wouldn't care for you anymore

But now, because you have acted like a victim, I won't be silent anymore

First, let talk about the in-game specialize 

Ppl still call you as best Gragas. But before joining GAM, you didn't know how to play Gragas, even before MSI you still didn't play this champ any match. After poor performance in training, I thought about Gragas and Galio (Gragas is Archie's best champ, he know his build and his laning very well)

The reason I thought about Gragas is because no champ can push wave, defence, be tanky, have crowd-control and make play like Gragas

In laning, Archie taught you about building items. I remind you why GAM was the only team that first pick Gragas. I said there are only Ekko and Fizz that have their Ultimate (R) with 100s CD like Gragas (in that patch), but both of those champs are non-meta, Kennen's R 120s, Renekton's R 120s, Camile's R 140s, Rumble's R 110s. Only Gragas's R is 100s CD, I picked this champ and told you how to play him in combat; always trade your ultimate with the enemy top lane, because the next time Levi came in top, your ultimate would CD faster than opponent's 10s, and the enemy top lane would lose. At that time, Lee Sin's R only had 70s CD, so if we picked both of those champs, we would won any fight

When GAM first picked Gragas several times and beat SuperMassive, their sp aka Dumbledoge analyzed that despite of their losing, they thought that your Gragas were nothing special

You, since the one who didn't know how to play Gragas, base on what that ppl call you as the best Gragas? I think you know 

About your Jayce solo killed Huni, I thinks that you also clearly know the reason

And talking about team living

Since you joined GAM, you had played your smurf account, not your main. I said that there is no elo boosting in GAM, and team members aren't allowed to play different accounts. However, you still used your smurf, despite I reminded you many times. Your smurf was anhdeptrai90, and because you were born in 1997, ppl wouldn't believe in you if you said that you're the owner of that account, and GAM would be influenced

I have told to GAM's members that they aren't allowed to be toxic in game. However, you, again, still be toxic in game, and got caught up by another pro-player, he asked me: is ""andeptrai90"" Stark's, why is he so toxic. I told you, but you didn't listen

Now you have joined another team, ppl say you still be very toxic, you always blame and insult other players. You don't even change your attitude 

And other things, but as I said before,  I blocked, ppl say things about you, no one negatives, no one let you be disadvantage. Do you remember how you ask me when joining team? Winner of VietNam, winner of GPL, and other things, you don't miss any money

When you left GAM, you forgot to bring your ID card. And when GAM changed gaming house, I lost my ID card, but I saw your card in the floor, then I picked, kept and brought it to GAM's new gaming house, because I think that you live in Da Nang, it will be difficult to make a new ID card if you lose it. I say it again, I lost my ID card, but I keep your card for you

But you're not satisfied with achievements you have claimed, things ppl ignore, then I will continue...",leagueoflegends,0
/r/leagueoflegends/comments/7be2o7/gam_manager_speaks_out_on_optimus_departure/dpignvg/,"He said that Stark didnt even play gragas before joining GAM and only play it because Tinikun told him so, in that patch the only 2 champion have the same ult cd with gragas(100s) are ekko and fizz which is out of meta, thats why gragas can trade and push with every toplane atm (renek 120s cd, kennen 120, camille 140, etc) and Tinikun also taught him how to trade, Archie taught him how to build item etc. And then he went from a non-gragas player to best gragas but its because of the team not himself because he refused to play gragas at the first place. 
Also Stark played another account in soloq (elo boost) and always blame people while Tinikun had warned him so many time. He even be recognized in soloq with different acc for toxic and blaming teammates.

/r/leagueoflegends/comments/7be5v0/come_experience_competitive_league_of_legends/dphnoqi/,"Hi. 

Im /u/abcdthc 

I used to be gold in LoL back in S3 and S4 i believe.  The new champion when i left was Lucian.

I quit because I have a very competitive nature.  I dont like to invest time in something if I don;t feel i have a shat at being top 10%. (at least)  

With LoL this wasnt going to happen.  I peaked at gold 3. I probly belonged in G5.

No matter how hard i tried i never could keep up in plat games.  I didnt have enough time, or im just not smart enough, whatever it is.

So i quit.


Recently I came back.  Now I dont need to be good anymore.  I want to improve but I dont need to validate my skills.

Ill never be plat, i dont have the time (i can only play 1 or 2 games a day tops, some days i cant play at all) Im okay with that.


That being said i am interested in ranked because i feel the matchmaking is better than normals.  I hate getting stomped, and i also hate doing stomping. 22-0 at 10 min is not fun for anyone really.  (at least to me its not)

AT this point though Im sooooo far behind.  I jungle and mid.  Bot is too much for me to handle and i find top boring.  I know jungling is probly not what i should be doing, but i did back in s3-s4 so i at least feel sort of comfortable.

Lots of new champs I dont know.  New monsters.  New masteries.  

Point is despite past experience, a basic understanding of trading and cs'ing and objective control....I'm a total noob.

Mechanics are like a level 10 player.  Map awareness is pretty bad honestly.  I have a long way to go.


But how far.  When is the right time for me to get into ranked?

Also is jungle a waste of time?  Should i just focus on the eaiser roles like top and mid?",leagueoflegends,0

To expand a bit on coaching, I don't believe we ever really assigned one to a team. We had a list of coaches, and teams chose them in a ""first come first serve"" style, many teams elected not to have one or chose one separate from the list entirely. 

As for the first part with not being able to dictate your roster, that's the unfortunate byproduct of having a league designed around meeting new players. 95%+ of the time it's awesome and it creates lasting friendships, but there are a few times/instances where players make the experience negative and ruin it for their team.

For reference, you're always allowed to remove players, and if you ask for an admin's help, it's pretty easy to find a suitably ranked replacement for them.

I love how this is just everyone's mentality infecting the queue, you've got 1-2 people just about every game saying ""It's just flex"" which is why I've settled with plat instead of diamond.

You've still got the ""you don't deserve to win this game"" or ""it's just my smurf""/""this elo is so easy I can spare a loss"" people in soloq but they're a lot less common.

/r/leagueoflegends/comments/7be5v0/come_experience_competitive_league_of_legends/dpjdbd6/,"You bring up a great point and we've had this conversation with our players, other leagues, and amongst ourselves as staff, and we've come to the conclusion that it's best to count it as the same as solo/duo for a couple main reasons.

The first, and by far the biggest that we heard, is that extreme cases like someone being plat/diamond flex but silver in solo/duo would technically be allowed to play rampage, and we don't feel that is fair. We had a player like that last season when we didn't count it and it was unfair and unfun for those involved, so we had to remove them from play and help the team find a replacement, leading to a rule change. 

Also, the way we have the rule is that it's pretty case-reliant and tentative to change. For example, if a plat 1 is diamond 3 in solo/duo, we will not allow them to play in our gold/plat league. However, if a 500 game gold 2 solo player is diamond 5 0LP in flex, we will more than likely allow them to play since their solo rank is noticeably lower with a good amount of games played.

Hopefully that sheds some light on why we have that rule in place, but as always we're open to changing anything, just need to hear the right amount of feedback from the community!",leagueoflegends,0

Not sure where the smurf trend part comes from... especially considering that almost all of the smurfs I've banned have come from competeleague. Not to mention the entire ring of smurfs that competeleague has even though everyone knows about it.

I don't even think we have a single 11 year old in the server? I would say our average age is anywhere from 16-22, not that it matters greatly.

That being said, competeleague is indeed larger and has more teams. To me, that just creates an environment where the individual loses their personal touch in the community... but that's probably just an opinion thing.

It wasn't long after the incentives were put up and the game got popular that they revamped the referral system and removed that reward. But, the players that received the referrals were never given this reward. Other rewards were given out, such as the item names being slowly rolled out over time. Totalbiscuit I'm pretty sure made a video or comment stating that he hadn't been given what was promised. Riot I don't think commented on this at all, and just seemed to be ignoring the problem to some fans - which is really in line with Riot's old(?) PR of not talking about things until they're nearly launched. A few years later, Riot finally said they were going to honor their ""promise"" and allow these people to design champions, and TotalBiscuit donated that privilege to the Make-A-Wish foundation.",leagueoflegends,0

The projects are champions who were kidnapped, turned into cyborgs, and had their thoughts and minds taken over.

Some were turned good after regaining control or never lost control such as vayne, ashe, and vi, some regained their memories or are struggling to regain them, such as master yi, and then there's people like zed, katarina, and jhin, who I assume maybe went into the project program willingly, or were forced but they were on the bad side anyways.

We know Ashe is the leader of a resistance, my guess would be that maybe Vayne was a part of it, and Ashe wanted to save all project subjects, however Vayne felt like some needed to be put down, such as Jhin, and as such became her own solo organization to put down any project subjects who aren't on the goodside.

There are 5 paths
each path has 3 Keystones, 3 Greater Runes, 3 Tier 2 Runes and 3 Tier 1 Runes. That makes

    5 * (3 * 3 * 3 * 3) = 405 Combinations for your first tree

I think where you went wrong is the second Tree: you can actually select any of the 9 Runes from all 3 Tiers as your first rune, and limits you to the 6 from the remaining 2 Tiers as the second rune.

    4 * (9 * 6) = 216 Combinations for your secondary runes

Edit: but since that would not see First [Rune A] then [Rune B] and First [Rune B] then [Rune A] as the same I have to devide the number by 2.
    
    FALSE (befoe Edit) 405 * 216 = 87480 Total combinations for the new Rune System
    CORRECT: 405 * 216/2 = 43740 Total combinations for the new Rune System (OP is correct)


Someone mentioned that the old Mastery System had more combinations wich is correct, but if you consider only ""viable"" variations (1 Keystone; you end your paths on one of the ""greater"" Masteries [the ones where you were able to choose 3]) the new Rune System propably comes out on top:


So for your Keystone Tree you have 

    3 * (2 * 3 * 2 * 3 * 2 * 3) = 648 Combnations

For your Secondary Tree(s) you had 4 Starting Points and after that could choose 3 greater Masteries. For the remaining 6 Points you again had 4 Starting points and 3 greater Masteries. 

    4 * 3 * 4 * 3 = 144 Combinations to spend your remaining points.

Similarly, 1/5 are Ins splashed (no overlap because you can't be Ins primary and secondary). Then 1/3 of them don't choose boots tier, and 2/3 of them do. We want to remove the 1/3 of 2/3 that take boots, so also subtract by

/r/leagueoflegends/comments/7boalz/what_is_your_secret_busted_pick_this_preseason/dpjkwge/,"Fucking Aatrox jungle is pretty ridiculous now. Not kidding, I'm looking forward to get back to D3 with that shit. 

So, if anyone wants to know why:

- Lethal Tempo is awesome for him, makes his all in even better, especially in 1v1's, he heals like crazy thanks to the extra attack speed, can also shut somebody down quickly with empowered autos on W. 

- The mastery that increases your damage the lower you are is another cool thing as you are very often balancing between 50-20% hp as Aatrox

- Restoring 15% of your missing health on champion takedowns can sometimes prevent enemies from popping down your revive passive, or simply extend its duration, allowing you to stay in fight for longer

- Permanent attack speed? Yay, what else could Aatrox even dream about? You can literally build 0 attack speed on him and his auto speed will still permanently be higher than with old runes and masteries unless you had a ton of attack speed in runes.

I don't know if my secondary runes are the best, maybe somebody has a better idea, but Ultimate Hat makes his ult cooldown laughably short, and Scorch feels nice for early ganks and duels, falls off later tho. Water walking feels like a decent replacement, especially for a jungler, and I'll try it out. 

I still don't know if he's any better than before compared to other champions as almost everything is simply OP now (PBE is fucking useless lmfao), but so far he feels nice. ",leagueoflegends,0

Splyce allowed their full roster to look for new opportunities, but since they just signed a new head coach for their LoL division I doubt they're looking to opt out. It's definitely not going to be G2 or Fnatic, and Misfits is unlikely as well. Schalke 04 is 100% not it either. That leaves us with five teams.

According to people behind the scenes, with franchising coming in 2019 some teams are running on borrowed time since they don't have the necessary financial resources. H2k might be people's first guess since they said teams needed 850K per year from Riot in order to be viable, but contrary to popular belief H2k's ownership is actually pretty affluent. They have the financial resources to opt into franchising in the NA LCS like the other four did, they just chose not to. Don't mistake the hesitation to keep incurring massive losses with the lack of financial resources. H2k asked for 850K, Riot gave them 500K. With franchising coming and Riot's compromise they might choose to stay, or still sell their spot. That's up in the air.

UoL is one of the financially weakest teams in the entire League and they just lost their core players. They're going to have a hard time. But according to rumours they re-signed Exileh and Samux (or was it Xerxe), and they were looking for a new team manager. So that suggests they're at least intending to stay for the 2018 season.

That leaves us with Giants, Roccat, and Vitality. Vitality has VC-ownership so they're definitely not going to sell their spot out of necessity. Roccat is basically one big marketing campaign for the title sponsor, a German gaming peripheral company. Question is if it's still worth it for them, since they joined the scene when owning a team was a lot less resource intensive. That leaves us with the last team, and I wonder why nobody ever mentions them: Giants. Despite their longevity, Giants is one of the old dogs created in a time where all you needed to have an esports team was put five guys together. They don't have the succes that other veterans like Fnatic have, and thus probably don't have big investments behind them the same way Fnatic, TSM, or CLG does.

>If it's H2k maybe we won't have to listen to them complain anymore.

The fact that you see owners being transparent about the financial issues that EU teams have as ""complaining"" makes you part of the problem. Instead of leveraging Riot by applying for a completely different league like Splyce, Fnatic, G2, and Misfits did, H2k showed a commitment to Europe and its fans by adressing an open letter at Riot and the fanbase. I found that admirable, since without we as fans might not have known about the financial issues organisations had. And I personally find it despicable that after asking for the community support by being completely transparant about the lack of viability in the current ecosystem people would write this of as ""complaining"".",leagueoflegends,0

As for replacing an existing team, the only thing we know so far is that this new team will be joining the existing European League of Legends team. Now they might start slow and hesitant the way PSG did, but with Challenger Series decimated a direct entry into LCS is pretty much non-existant. They'd have to go through the entire cycle of the national leagues with limited viewership just to qualify for 2019, which is pointless because then franchising kicks in.

and when your hero hits 5, you get 500 gold. Most heroes cost 10,000 and xp dropoffs dont happen until after you get your 500 gold

/r/leagueoflegends/comments/7btf27/league_just_straight_copied_hots_system_but/dpku0mj/,"You cant compare HotS to League they just share the same genre and core elements of it.

HotS is faster, funnier and more ""casual"" to play. You progress faster in HotS, for example you could get around 1-2 levels for a single win with a new champion which means 1 loot chest per level. You can also get a new hero unlocked if you are lucky in those chests without having to spend additional ingame currency to fully unlock it.

Riot copied a working and ""good"" system (its still flawed, the HotS sub is ranting about it daily too) and made it worse so they can get more money out of it. They limited the amount of chests you could get while playing (so they essentially punish players who play more), they added keys (and key fragments, what the fuck) and before you get to enjoy anything out of your chests you actually have to spend currency that is super hard to get.

Out of the hallows end event (started 2-3 weeks ago), I've gotten nearly every skin and other items, with 5/10 legendary skins as well. I haven't spent my shards on anything (10k now) and only spend my gold (30k) on rerolling loot boxes.

>hots system rewards its players more than riot's on not one, but TWO different currencies.

Actually, there are three.  

Gold is the most common, you get a small amount of gold when you complete a match (more if you win,) by doing quests, by leveling up characters (Every five character levels alternates between 500g and a hero specific loot box. Levels 5, 15, 25, etc get you 500 gold, and levels 10, 20, 30 get you a second loot box on top of the one you get every level. ). You also get an influx of gold at the end of a ranked season, depending on how high you got. 

You use gold to buy heroes and reroll loot chests. 

You get shards from duplicate items, and you use shards to make cosmetics. 

Gems, the third currency, is what you pay real money to get. You also get 150 gems every 25 player levels.  You can use gems to buy heroes, stimpacks (gets you increased xp and gold per game.  They also can spawn in loot chests) and loot chests.  

As you can probably tell, I’ve played ~~a bit ~~ a lot of HotS, and I own almost a every hero and didn’t pay a cent.  

*edit:*.   I really like the system. At its face it’s a bit complicated, but it rewards you frequently and you typically have the currency to get what you want.  ",leagueoflegends,0

Hots is basically one big brawl from start to finish. If you enjoy the 1v1 laning of league I wouldn't recommend it. If you like mid late game team fights then it's prolly better for you than league. I enjoy both games for what they are

Early game you’re right.  At level 1, the XP you earn from a kill is *less* than an entire minion wave, and the respawn is about 10 seconds.  

However, this becomes less and less true the longer a game goes on.  A single kill in the late game can completely turn the tide of a match.   If one team is far behind, that kill gives *enormous* amounts of XP. (Sometimes a full level’s worth).  Not to mention the dead player has to wait 60 seconds to respawn. 

I’ve won many a losing match in HotS from getting a single pick, then using the 4v5 advantage to take control of the map and win the game...

I’ve also lost many games when someone (myself included) gets caught out of position and gives huge momentum to the other team.

/r/leagueoflegends/comments/7btf27/league_just_straight_copied_hots_system_but/dpm56zn/,"I hate playing HOTS because it feels like you have no contribution as a  single player. Because of how teamwork focused it is, your team is dragged down to the level of the worst player. Meanwhile in LoL if you have a teammate who's 10% worse than the average you can make up for it by being 10% better than the average yourself. You will acquire an advantage in resources for yourself and can leverage it to cover up for somebody who did worse in a match. And with your higher skill level you would get better use out of those resources.

Meanwhile hots shares all the resources (exp) between the team so you can't get a personal advantage to leverage, you're being dragged down by the lowest common denominators. Also the massive importance on map objectives (while they're cool...) means you're basically forced to have a ""baron call"" every 5 minutes of the game. From the start of the game. Where the worst person on your team will completely screw over your team by getting to the call late or doing something wrong, on an objective that requires great teamwork from all 5 players to beat the other team in whatever the objective is. 

Playing HOTS solo queue is the worst experience I've ever had playing a MOBA game because it feels like whatever plays I make are irrelevant because it all gets decided in 5v5 objectives where only the skill level of the worst player on the team matters, and it's rarely possible to make amazing plays because you can't be strong enough to make a difference alone.

Ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhh...

It really depends on how the other lanes are doing.  If one guy gets fed on the enemy team early but other teammates are winning their lanes and such, it's not difficult to come back from that early deficit.   Some of that was definitely taken away currently due to how heavily burst-centric Preseason changes have made the game, but at least at lower elos people who get early leads tend to throw it just as hard.

Hitches, performance and camera issues are nothing that gets posted in the sub at all, i am there every day and the last something like that was posted was almost a year ago, like in Lol, Dota 2 and every other game there will always be some performance hikups after some patches. Lol had the same problem a while ago when after a patch the fps would randomly drop even on good machines.

We have a spectator mode (you might want to check your facts dude, we have that thing for more than a year)

Trading is still ominous but was hinted at, but that is nothing vital that is preference, each game has its own implementation of draft and trading is not a must have. There are some for and some against it.

We have a voice chat comming in the patch next week.

A surrender option will **never be a thing** and its a good thing that it will never come, it give the player only two choices, play to win or go afk and get reported and therefore in the future banned.
The hots team said multiple times that a surrender option will never be a thing, especially since games are only 17-27min. And im glad it wont be a thing.
Just because other games have it, doesnt mean HotS needs to have it too, like i said before each is a different game with a different vision.

Stat-tracking API was multiple times hinted at and will most likely come in the future but that is so far from vital, you can play the game without knowing your minute stats totally fine.

What others have been ""mentioned countless times over the past few years?"" Dude you are obviously reaching to fill your list, half your points werent even a thing, were already in the game or are coming. 

Heroes of the Storm is **not** League of Legends, thats why we play it and the majority doesnt want some of the changes you said ""were posted multiple times"" because we want this game to be different than LoL, most of us got here from Lol or other MOBAs **because** it isnt Lol. Its fine to say that HotS needs features, thats a totally valid obersavtion, but the way you worded it and badly researched what is actually wanted and already in game, just shows that you wanted to fill your argument in any kind of way without actual knowledge.

>something to make people feel like this is more than a casual slugfest would be amazing.

This obviously shows that you havent really spend much time in HotS, its a game based in teamwork and coordination and less focused on a feeded carry and 4 support players for him like in Lol (obviously an exaggerated visual just like yours).

If you think a team based game is ""a casual slugfest"" why play at all? Stay at Lol and be happy, dont try to make HotS the Lol 2.0 because for whatever reason you want it to adopt everything from Lol.

>I struggle to imagine this game lasting almost ten years as League has and still being held back by this awful, punishing system.

Dude you really have no idea do you? The sub and playerbase is constantly growing since it was alpha released. The big 2.0 update brought so many players that queues are currently less than 10s and in the second to next patch (about 3-4 weeks) we will get a perfomance based matchmaking to raise the quality of games even more.

The majority doesnt mention the reconnect system, because we posted multiple times about it and we got multiple blue answers over the years explaining how its limited by the engine but they are working on it all the time to improve it. We got multiple improvements over the years, today its not even bad and takes less than 20s to rejoin and start playing. But do you know why these posts arent a thing anymore? Because the Blues answered that something is in the near future for the reconnect system **and we as players believe in them and trust their word.**

Do you know why that is a thing? Because the HotS team is extremely active in our sub, sometimes just participating and joking around, sometimes given meaningful input, other times just giving small hints at future stuff. But most of all, they connect with the community **and listen**. We as a sub have gotten so many changes and new content releases because they listened and implemented them.

There were more than a few skins or heroes released close (a few months) after a big post about X hero hit the frontpage of that reddit, it could be an coincident, but honestly id rather believe in the other.

What im getting at is this:

You tried badly to downplay HotS as a game with ""its many bad and nonexistent vital features"" that arent even a vital feature, are already in the game or announced for the future. You complain mostly that HotS isnt Lol and sorry, but if that is your problem: **Just go play Lol, we love HotS how it is, thats why we left Lol to come here.**

I can see in every word here--and now that I look back, your previous comments--were all made in a defensive, aggressively sanctimonious manner as if I were someone attacking Heroes, perhaps a 'lofty' LoL player as you seem to assume and imply, and you've taken no other direction in replying to me.

HotS easily surpassed my DotA 2 playtime, caught up to my Smite playtime, and is nearing my League playtime, across multiple accounts, close to a hundred friend recruitments, and has led me to upsell the game in a similar (but less condescending) manner as you have, to whoever will listen or to whoever still blindly shills out their MOBA of choice without ever even having played HotS. I think, having been a part of the community since beta, having been there for all of the ins and outs, and survived until now with the features the game is still missing, that I've earned the right to have an honest look at it without being called out as a non-existant fanboy.

Nothing I've said is wrong, shit that's ""already in the game"" needs work, and everything else you've said is either irrelevant--as per Blizzard responding to this shit, when they said more than a year ago that hero trading was coming ""soon""--or a personal opinion, which is pretty much also irrelevant since I listed off a string of factually absent or neglected parts of the game. Such as the front page post I mentioned about the replay issue *that was posted today*. But those don't happen anymore, do they?

Overall, your post length and concise summary was a welcome change from the typical shit-throwing I put up with most of the time, but your tone, from every sneering reference to one of many other games I play to your specifically bolded sections designed to ""defeat me"" and repel me from this game are childish and unnecessary. If you'd even read my original post with anything but a contemptuous air, you'd have noticed that I said HotS needs these things to thrive and that is and will always be the case; people play HotS in large because it's not like any other game, but it's still a MOBA, and *millions* more people play and love league of Legends every single day because of many things is does well. Similarly, there are things that DotA does, and that Smite does, and that HoN does, and Heroes of the Storm taking a page or two or just a phrase from these other games if it's a good choice isn't a bad idea just because they're coming from other games. You aren't currently shitting on Heroes for having minions, lanes, towers, bases, mages, experience, a minimap, lootboxes, right-click movement, skins, a ranked mode, replays, jungle camps, recalling, or map objectives, and these are all things League also has. For a reason. And acting like I didn't specifically mention any of these things in complete reference to making HotS do better as a game and gain even more players is just asinine. Why make a problem that wasn't there just so you can call me out for it?

I might have also leaned on how vital some of these are, but it wasn't something I was planning on driving into the ground. Right now, as someone with an internet that makes him suffer *tremendously* long reconnect times on those rare occasions where it comes up--robbing sometimes near ten minutes of my life away as I struggle to rejoin the team that now plans on reporting me as they sail to a usually easy loss with a man down--that's a major point for me. And as someone who hates praying that the first player on our team who gets to pick in draft also happens to be good with one of the top two or three pick and ban characters in the game, trading is pretty much what I want most in HotS right now. But the rest, regardless of how you or I feel about them, are all very good issues with Heroes that constantly come up. And if you don't believe me, Google it yourself, or search the subreddit; I'd do it here, but I'm tired of trying to prove something to someone who just seems to be out to make me into an imaginary villain that never existed in the first place.

What I'm getting at is this:

Past that though, historically I think Riot has had a pretty low monetization rate for a f2p game, so the existing ecosystem is probably at least reasonably fair.

The move this season to runes reforged + level up capsules seems to me like they are removing the pain point of runes, but are restructuring post game rewards to be less favorable to the player so that they aren't taking a massive revenue hit.  If all they did was get rid of the IP sink that is runes, they are probably hurting their sales tremendously, so enter BE on level up and unpredictable rewards to help convince players to pay.

Again I don't really like the current system, but old runes sucked and I understand that if your monetization % is already pretty low, you can't take out one of your main ip sinks.",leagueoflegends,0

/r/leagueoflegends/comments/7btf27/league_just_straight_copied_hots_system_but/dpl3lb2/,"I see HOTS design as much more liberated than LoL. HOTS isn't afraid to put some seriously weird stuff in the game. Abathur, The Lost Vikings, Cho Gall, Murky...these are all very unique and strange heroes that Riot would never have the balls to try to put in their game. I will admit that Riot's designs have been getting more unique and better lately but for a few solid years they cranked out tanky dps with a gap closer and a slow or stun over and over and over, interspersed with ""mage that casts spells to do damage, but this one's different because his shot goes at right angles,"" or whatever. 

I love some of the new champions I'm seeing like this spell steal girl and Ivern and Bard. people with really crazy moves that fundamentally change the rules of the game. HOTS embraces that more often with weird characters like I mentioned above. 

I think having a gameplay setup where dying once or twice early isn't too punishing is good because it makes the game more teamplay focused as opposed to, ""Well, that guy is fed now, so it doesn't matter that his kit is just Standard ADC Carry or Regular Tanky DPS Guy, he's gonna kill us."" 

Valeera's a pain but she's not *really* invisible. You can handle her by anticipating where she is going, and then watching for her shimmer, and picking heroes that have skillshots to bring her out. It's her way of forcing you to fundamentally change the way you approach the game. Now YMMV on whether that's ""fun"" or not... but It's something. but yeah. As for Tracer...idunno. She's more fun for the player because the player is constantly playing risk reward. You have to stay in range but also out of range at the same time. Being on the other end of it is not as interactive because you can't do as much as she can. I'd say you have to force her to play defensively but its hard. haha. ",leagueoflegends,0

Many are not interested in what some would call league’s passive laning phase where everyone farms money for ten to fifteen minutes before the actual game begins. Obviously there’s more going on at this point the higher you go in rank. But in some ways there’s less. At a certain point being good at league means being passive and not fighting. Seeking to interact with your opponent as little as possible. That’s not good game design is it? Meanwhile hots forces interaction early and often, giving players batted to pick between.

/r/leagueoflegends/comments/7btmef/make_first_win_of_the_day_reset_at_set_time/dpku1lh/,"The problem about this is that it's meant to give you an incentive to play the game every day. If you have a fixed time at which it resets players who normally start playing near the end of one daily cycle can play the game only every other day and get the full daily win bonus for every day. So basically depending on your time zone the system will either favor you or not, which leads to frustrating situations.

Now I don't know if this has changed with the mission, but the compensation used to be that the timer would only count down 22 hours instead of 24, so you can start playing (or winning to be more precise) up to 2 hours earlier than the day before and still be fine.

You do not need to dump 100K IP (BE) on runes anymore. The only thing you can do with BE now is buy champs and level mastery. 

And about the conspiracy that Riot somehow wants to fuck over the veterans:
You've either been playing for a long time and have all or most of the champs you need. Not to mention, you got all the IP from runes refunded because of which Riot opened the BE store so you have something to spend BE on and it jsut doesn't sit there. 

Or you've been playing since the past couple of years and ahve a moderate amount of champs and you got all the IP from runes refunded which leaves you with a lot of BE. I've been playing since 1.5 years, and received around 45K BE yesterday, all of which I used to buy 8 champs and a couple of icons.

What happened for me is that when everyone picked and it changes to ""choose your loadout"" while you have unfinished runes open it switches to a preset page. Now if you want to change the obe rune you tried to change just before it doesn't let you.

1. He actually has personality. A ton of new streamers make the mistake of playing and being too silent, but qt talks a lot. He makes jokes, gives a lot of great tips for laning and strategy on a macro scale at various points in the game, etc. 

2. He's unpredictable. He says shit that nobody else comes up with and it's hard to guess what he'll say/do next. He's also good enough to pull off some off-meta builds, even at the highest levels of play so that can be fun too. It's fun when it works and sometimes it's even funnier when it doesn't. His reactions can be priceless.

3. He's a great fucking player. Sometimes he just pops off and carries hard. It's incredibly fun to watch someone just roflstomp all over the enemy team 1v3, 1v4, 1v5. 

4. Guests. He also does a lot of duo-queue stuff with other popular players like Annie Bot, Scarra, Dyrus and IWDominate. Qt has great chemistry with these players, especially Annie Bot and IWDominate, leading to some fantastic moments.

This way they could control what kind of content consistently hit the front page, meaning they'd profit off the ad revenue and fuck over anyone else trying to promote their own content. Also they were all sponsored by WTFast which was claimed by many to be a scam.

If you want a better description I'd say google LoL reddit vote manipulation",leagueoflegends,0
/r/leagueoflegends/comments/7cxmky/imaqtpie_witnesses_evolved_bm/dpul8ph/,"Long story short:

1. Ton of big youtubers had a pretty big-ish skype group (they invited people that were getting big to it, so there's definitely more names than the ones people list).

2. As far as I know at first they used it mostly to exchange ideas and such, discuss between themselves.

3. Very easily they discovered vote brigarding was pretty easy, especially since if a video has say, 30-50 upvotes within 5 minutes, it's far easier to make it to the front page.

4. Didn't really stop there, as with that power they could also downvote other content creators and make sure their videos were the most watched ones or just to fuck over content creators that they didn't like.

5. They were exposed after they tried to (and managed to) recruit Vvvortic (a VERY popular troll at the time, been ages since I've seen him mentioned anywhere else).

6. Vvvortic was on pretty bad terms with quite a few content creators on the group (See: he was a massive fucking troll on pretty much any popular LoL youtube vid), which caused him to go rogue and try to come clean with the situation.

7. As far as I know, he went to Gnarsies and Gnarsies bought some attention to the matter. Not only was the group vote brigarding, there were some pretty deplorable things being said there, I believe Uberdanger bragged about banging his (underaged?) fans there if I'm not mistaken, among others that I don't recall.

8. Attention was bought, the content creators were banned from the subreddit at the time and Vvvortic pretty much dissapeared into obscurity.

That's most of it as far as I remember. If I missed something (or something's wrong) feel free to correct me (Copy pasted from another reply I did so someone else).",leagueoflegends,0

It's not a scam, it's just that almost not a single person weighing in on whether it was a scam or was not a scam actually knew how the fuck it worked. So it was just a bunch of morons arguing back and forth with no substance with one side biased due to the sponsorship money, and one side looking to pitchfork the creators that benefited from it and disliked the ""gaming"" advertisement for a VPN.

It was just a VPN. A friend gave me his account once to use on the League servers back when east coast ping was atrocious. I went from 120 ping to around 80-90ish using WTFast. The reasoning is that they provide a less congested and more efficient route of my packets to the Riot server. Less hops, less packet loss, less congestion = less ping.

Your results will vary to an extreme amount. Some people will see net losses in ping if you're not under the right circumstances. Some will see almost no difference. Some, like me, will notice a significant difference - enough to be worth considering.

Yes, the gaming advertisement is dumb and flashy. But I'm betting everyone that complained about that has at least one ""gaming"" product between their monitors, keyboards, mice, chairs, etc.

It's a VPN. Even a non-gaming VPN can have a similar effect. They say they specialize in dealing with the type of packet demands that gaming has. Maybe they work out peering deals to better route packets for popular games, on that count I don't know.",leagueoflegends,0

/r/leagueoflegends/comments/7cxmky/imaqtpie_witnesses_evolved_bm/dpurl5w/,"There is a difference between someone's political views maligning with an author, and the author being a horrible person. 

But this doesn't quite fit here as you've misunderstood what ""Death of the Author"" truly means. The common discourse in current day Literature is the influences of a writer mean significantly less than the meaning derived from a reader.

The only text I can think of as a good example is 1984. Some would argue that seeing since Orwell fought in the Spanish Civil War (Homage to Catalonia), and had vast experiences of his own (can't quite remember well enough...), would imply that the ONE and ONLY meaning of that book is a warning against totalitarian regimes and so on; or in other words, that the things Orwell was thinking at the time of writing. What death of the author implies, is that the historical context, his personal life, and so on, actually mean very little in determining the true meaning of his text (hint: it's whatever meaning you, as a reader got from it).

The issue with putting the author on a pedestal is that it assumes a text is ""autonomous"", which is completely untrue. The idea that a text is ""an island"" (self-contained, exist in a void...), is greatly flawed. Because this postulates that an author's influences (literary speaking) have no bearing. When in reality, all texts are very closely related (that's the idea of intertextuality). The shift from the author being the ""end-all, be-all"" decider of what a text really means, is not really a valid view anymore. Some would argue otherwise, but the arguments against it are quite compelling, at least in my opinion.


It's more interesting in seeing that ways that a reader responds to a text. That is, what connections and associations does a reader derive from a work. 

I suppose you're right in saying that an author's personal life shouldn't detract from the perceived quality of their work. However, in the case of ""Death of the Author"", it places emphasis on what meaning a reader gets from a text, rather than the meaning intended by the author. And in this case, you're misinterpreting it as conflating quality of character to quality of text. 

So in summation, what meaning is really derived from these guys works? Not a whole lot. Am I allowed to avoid content by someone who I see, as amoral and deplorable? Absolutely. Am I avoiding their content because I disagree with their world view? No, I dislike them as people. But then again, you may say ""avoiding them because you don't like them is just as dumb..."", not really. 

If I found out my favourite musician, or author was a horrible person, I would stop supporting their content. Especially if they try and shut-out aspiring content creators. It's like they're trying to hold a monopoly on content, and colluded with each other. It takes a real horrible person to try diminish the creative works of others for their own personal gain. But hey, you can still enjoy someone's work even if they are a bad person. For me, I don't like divulging in content made by what I consider scum-bags. But that's not to say their content is bad, or that I'm judging their work from their personal life, but rather I do not wish to support their behaviour. I see it like the whole EA fiasco that's going on; consistently bad acts should not be met with praise. Make them atone for what they've done.

Interpretation != objective analysis (good, bad etc.) through indicators such as (are they a good person, do their world-views align with my own...?)

Rather Interpretation == subjective analysis (what does this mean to me?).

But hey, this is just my opinion.

Also, death of the author is problematic, for it assumes that the text exists in vacuum. When you remove the text's authority, all it does is replace it with the reader's contemporary perspective that influences the interpretation of a text. If you try to read Pride and Prejudice without historical context, it's most likely a love story. With historical context, it is now a text that may be criticizing misogynistic marriage customs. While people shouldn't assume texts as historical fact (the idea of written texts counting as law dates WAY back), they do need to see what conversation is occurring between texts. You can only achieve this with historical research and intertextuality.

So far several thousand people are complaining about low gains in general, about a dozen have complained that they get some specific weird low drop number (eg ""I only got 3*90), none of those have provided proof that what they said is true, some of them have provided proof contradicting themselves (ie proving they were wrong).

I say we introduce a whole new mechanic to nocturne where he can actually possess people to control their moments for a short while.

Kinda like like a mixture of Kayn ultimate but with the mechanical effects of Sylvanas's Mind Control from HoTS (Starro in Infinite Crisis also had a similar ability not that anyone remembers that game lul). In the Lux/Garen story Nocturne is shown to be a possessing type demon and no longer a dream-stalker like Krueger. Instead what he does is he taps into your nightmares to give them reality using his shadow powers. 

I think that would be a much more interesting game mechanic since we already have sleep but knowing Riot cant keep themselves from rehashing the same mechanic at least twice( like Elementalist Lux/Kayn Evolution or Graves/Jhin Reload) the sleep thingy will probably be there.",leagueoflegends,0

/r/leagueoflegends/comments/7d48l2/if_sleep_becomes_a_more_common_mechanic_later/dpvygks/,"Honestly this is great. We could change some of his kit to feel more skilled to perform (and not just stuff tacked onto basic attacking) 
His E is like warwick's E (where instead of fearing people around him, he makes them drowzy and later sleeping)

If Nocturne attacks somebody who's sleeping, he cleaves around them and gets some %HP back (this is his passive)

His spellshield should be reworked into something that makes sense (like some sort of anti-cc stuff), don't really see why he needs the attack speed boost if we change this (unless basic-attacking reduces the cooldown on his E) 

His Q could benefit from some change too, but I really like the thing  that he stalks his enemies in his own twisted shadow world. Thinking it could be great if he shoots forth a shadow hand that latches onto the first enemy (maybe making them drowzy) while still creating a shadow path up to them. From there on, only whoever he hit with the hand leaves a trail (which should be smaller , but give a bigger speed boost) 

Also this gives some thought into his ultimate, which could be as /u/HolypenguinHere suggests with several Nocturne clones charging at everyone, but disappearing only when they get really close to him.

Maybe give a tiny slow (and a good visual effect with that fuckin ghost claw) to his Q or maybe just change some shit so he has a bit more sticking power and make his R fear in a small area around his target (compensated for with flat damage nerfs of course) so that he can play more as a fighter instead of only being viable as an assassin.

Nocturne is pretty 1 dimensional now as just a 1 shot assassin guy but I think it'd be nice if he could keep that playstyle as an option while being offered the choice through his build to opt for a durable fighter route with a bit more CC and survivability.

Q - Nightmare Puddle - Nocturne throws a puddle of Nightmares on the ground He gets extra movespeed when walking on it, and deals damage to targets hit. Nightmare Puddles Deal extra damage to Asleep targets and fears them once they wake up

W - Dream shield - Nocturne defends himself with other people's dreams, giving him a temporary spell shield, if Dream Shield defends a Spell His passive's cooldown resets

E - Drowsyness - Nocturne attaches a tether to someone and they become Drowsy for a while, if the tether doesn't break, The target sleeps

R - Wake up! - Nocturne reduces enemy vision and can jump to a target on a certain range, dealing damage. (the current range, maybe more, idk) if the target is asleep he deals (10% of his ad) Damage and can take control of him!

Especially Nocturne, you never see him until he gets the right items in meta like Duskblade to play more like a Japanese pilot in WW2 than an assassin or bruiser or whatever.    Especially with Nocturne's kinda lack of counterplay when it comes to assassinations, he pretty much Ults (unstoppable btw) onto a target and one shots them with an auto attack.  And I know you can argue ""well don't be alone"" or ""he can't do anything after he kamikazes onto you"" but really, being point and click one shotted by a Nocturne is not fun or interactive no matter how you look at it.

I'm fine with him when he's just a bruiser or whatever but he's never played when he's a bruiser, only when he's a one click one shot.

So if a champion is only played when they're played to have very little counterplay and just a one shot machine, I don't think that's a good kit design.  There are a lot worse kit designs but Noc's pisses me off.",leagueoflegends,0

/r/leagueoflegends/comments/7d48l2/if_sleep_becomes_a_more_common_mechanic_later/dpvm7un/,"His theme is consistent and pulled off well yeah.  All nightmare themed.  A scary monster chasing you wherever you run (Q), can't stop him no matter what you try (spellshield), he's scary (the fear), and his ult making you feel so alone and helpless.  It's a consistent theme which I can appreciate, it's not something off like Shen with his weird ass spirit blade.

But I think age wears his effect down.  There are some things that can legit jump scare me under certain circumstances.  Like just last night I was trying out the ol Tristana jungle (thanks front page), and I was clearing my wolves when khazix jumps outta nowhere and one shots me.  I fall outta my chair or anything but I jumped a little.  Same with like Rengar jumping out of a brush and one shotting you.  Or the adrenaline and anxiety of knowing you're being hunted and chased down by a Warwick with the scary music playing while you're hunted.

Nocturne.... he doesn't have the real fear factor.  None of his sound effects are loud or intimidating (besides eternum ult noise).  I feel less scared of Nocturne and more ""well cool I'm fucked"" or ""huh this darkness is annoying"".  

And I think a Visual Update at the least would help that.  Make him louder, more intimidating, really scary instead of how he is right now.  They're consistent with the theme and I think they did the best they could at the time, but time wears down on it.",leagueoflegends,0

/r/leagueoflegends/comments/7d48l2/if_sleep_becomes_a_more_common_mechanic_later/dpv1at1/,"Domination: Electrocute, sudden impact, eyeball collector, either out of combat MS or active item cdr.

Sorcery: Ult hat, scorch

Full build: Triforce, R. Hydra, Gunblade, 3x lethality.

Lvl 18, full build, full combo (channel edge of night and activate ghostblade -> R-Q-AA-Hydra-AA-Gunblade, plus mash W and E whenever you feel like it) does 3400 damage to a practice dummy in around half a second, and is available on a 40 second cooldown. 

Build order: Early triforce, rush 40% cdr, otherwise very flexible

Ways to rush 40% cdr:

(1) Tri, Ghostblade, Duskblade, t1 boots (with ghostblade's MS you don't need t2 and you won't have boots in your full build anyway). This is the best burst build.
(2) Tri, Duskblade, Ionian, Tiamat, Vamp Scepter if needed. This is the defensive build path for games where you need waveclear, since once you get tiamat you can Q-AA a wave for instant clear. You'll need this against champs like Zed, Orianna, who can shove you in and bully you hard if you lack waveclear (this is a mid/top noc, btw; I prefer ignite/flash)

This may be the only time poacher's dirk is a good item; since you'll be building 3xLethal, you can afford to just sit on it for a while if you're unable to stack right away.

Some matchups are really hard (if you're against a Taliyah, your only choice is to farm under tower; do not attempt tiamat waveclear strategy as she will dps you down). Others are a free win (katarina lol). In some matchups (Lux) you need to start W at level 1 so you can safely shove to hit lvl 2 first.

When you hit 6, start stacking that ultimate hat looking for kills. Like other assassins, Noc struggles if he gets far enough behind that jhe can no longer burst theor squishies. However, if you're just a little behind (or, if you're even with other lanes but your lane opponent is fed), it doesn't really matter since you will be able to oneshot them anyway.",leagueoflegends,0

Noc is an assassin that shines in midgame and is shit at every other time in the game, and to shine, at least in competitive, you need to give him special attention, when you can give the same attention to either of your carries and get better results, while also picking a jungler like Vi, Jarvan, Xin, Warwick, Kha, all champions that can do what Noc can do without needing to be babied.",leagueoflegends,0

Honestly I think Nocturne's strongest mid build is still going smite and getting Red Warrior, it's just so cost effective.

After having played Noc Mid for 3 seasons I really feel like I can say that 40% CDR is not needed in higher elo. There are less kills overall, people's positioning is better, and supports are more peel-y. You need to rush damage to be able to get  key picks on whoever you can, and get objectives off that. You can't just rush 40% and kill people 24/7 because at some point people start grouping and peeling for whomever you jump on.

**Passive 1: Rival**: At the start of the game, choose one player on the enemy team, and one of their base abilities. When you are within <range> of your rival, an indicator will display when that ability, as well as their ultimate ability, are off of cooldown.

**Passive 2: Change Pokémon**: Pre-game, you choose 3 Pokémon to take into battle with you. You may change your active Pokémon at any point as long as you are not suppressed. There is a 2/1.5/1 second window as you change where you cannot attack or use abilities. Your AA range, base damage type, and move set is dependent on who you bring into battle. Allies and enemies can see your available Pokémon on your buffs bar. Any status effects caused by a Pokémon remain for their duration, even when that Pokémon is no longer on the Rift.

Ideas for the Pokémon:

**Venusaur**: Melee AA, AD based. Consecutive AAs against champions & large monsters grant a stack of Leech Seed, up to 5 stacks. Each stack beyond the first grants X% lifesteal on each AA. Only one champion/monster can have stacks at any time.  
- Q=Vine Whip (ranged)  
- W=Wrap (can activate as AA or Q hits to root for a short time)  
- E=Growl (AOE enemy damage decreased by % for X seconds)  
- R=either Petal Dance (AOE damage followed by a brief CD where abilities cannot be used) or Solar Beam (think Vel'koz ult with damage & small heal for allies)

**Charizard**: Melee AA, AP based.  
- Q=Flamestrike (short-ish ranged skillshot, damages enemies in a line and sets them ablaze [Brand Q + Ezreal E, but shorter])  
- W=Wing Attack (dash through target, dealing damage to all enemies passed through)  
- E=Fire Spin (Line of fire spins around Charizard 3 times, damaging all enemies. Refreshes [does not set] ablaze. Ablaze enemies hit by Fire Spin are feared for <time>.)  
- R=Inferno (After brief channel, set area around Charizard on fire. Enemies take AP damage every half second. Ablaze champions take true damage on the first tick.)

**Blastoise**: Short ranged AA (water cannons), tank/AP based. AAs vs. champions with a Pool Party skin equipped do 50% damage.  
- Q=Bubblebeam (Ziggs zone ability, but in a line)  
- W=Iron Defense (increase Armor/MR passively, activate to reflect damage for a short amount of time)  
- E=Shell Attack (withdraws into shell, dashes in a line, will briefly knock up/back the first champion/large monster hit [Rammus Q effect])  
- R=Hydro Pump (shoots out large wall of water, knocking enemies aside [Taliyah wall] and creating an impassable wall wide enough that enemies cannot flash over)

**Pikachu**: Ranged AA, AP based. AAs apply 1 mark of Static Charge to a target, stacking up to 3 times  
- Q=Thunderbolt (short-range targeted ability. Hitting enemy with Static Charge will additionally deal 50% damage to nearby enemies, range increased by number of stacks. Can chain if jump hits another enemy with Static Charge)  
- W=Thunder Wave (channel electricity on an area. If in area for <time>, become stunned for a moment. Stunning enemy with Static Charge deals a burst of damage. Damage and stun length increased by number of stacks of Static Charge)  
- E=Quick Attack (dash to target area, do a small amount of damage. 1/1/2/2/3 charges on a short cooldown)  
- R=Thunder (call down pillar of electricity on your location. Nearby enemies take damage, are silenced for .1 seconds, and gain 1 stack of Static Charge)

Additionally, you could set it up so certain Pokémon (Venusaur, in this example) deal extra damage to certain champs (Malphite), less damage to other champs (Brand, Annie), and take more (Brand/Annie) or less (Nami) damage from certain champion's abilities, based on type. Probably way overkill, but hey, it's all in good fun.

QR sword drones, increases her attack speed to 2.5 for 2 seconds
WR shield drones, creates a barrier that block X damage and removes CC as well as granting CC immunity for 4 seconds or until 1 second after shield breaks, whichever is first

/r/leagueoflegends/comments/7d4hyy/a_character_from_your_favorite_movietv_showvideo/dpvq4x9/,"**Artoria Pendragon** [Saber Fate Series](https://images.alphacoders.com/784/thumb-1920-784997.png) She draws excalibur from the stone to become king- and is magically turned into a man/made to appear as a man to fill the role of king. As a king that fights among her people, she naturally leads her people in battle, but is eventually betrayed by many of her followers. 

Passive - **AVALON**: Increases her Armor and Magic Resist by 15% when damaged by an enemy champion, this boost stays until you leave combat. When Artoria's health falls under 30% she regenerates 30% of her missing health over 10 seconds. Both have a separate CD of 60 seconds.

Q - **DISABLING STRIKE**: Saber dashes forward (300 range but fast) and stuns the first champion with the hilt of her sword for a short time (0.5-1sec) and does 10-15% of their current hp as damage. (15-10 second CD)

W - **KING OF KNIGHT'S VALOR/SERVANT'S AGILITY**: 
**KING OF KNIGHT'S VALOR**: Artoria passively gains a flat amount of movement speed when another melee champion (either team) is within 750 range of her. This passive goes on cooldown while Servant's Agility is in use.
**SERVANT'S AGILITY**: Activating her Servant's Agility ability, Artoria gains a massive boost of movement speed for 1.5 seconds and nearby allies gain half the amount for 0.75 seconds. While this ability is active, Artoria can climb over small walls and terrain. (30-20 second CD)

E - **MANA BURST/SWORD MASTERY**:
**MANA BURST**: Artoria uses a small amount of mana in her basic attacks adding 2% of her total Armor and Magic Resist to her basic attacks as damage. (doesn't raise her AD stat, just adds more to her basic attack damage if that makes sense.)
**SWORD MASTERY**: Artoria slashes in a small AOE in front of her up to 5 times dealing damage and shredding % Armor and Magic resist with each strike. (Think of Riven's Q with no mobility, and each consecutive slash shreds a lot less) (20-15 second CD)

R - **EXCALIBUR**: Artoria channels for 1.5 seconds then fires a focused blast of magic from her sword in a straight line (~1500 range) that executes any champion below 20% HP and knocks back any champions within 500 range of her (Like A-SOL's ult) it can be activated after 1 second for a 750 range blast, half damage and a 10% execute. (180-100 second CD)

She would be a mobile Top lane tank that synergizes very well with melee champs, especially Taric/Sejuani/Braum but goes well in any team comp that likes to engage. She doesn't do much of any burst, but if you fight her in a sustained battle she will eventually shred you down and survive with her passive's boost of stats and regeneration. She would probably build pure tank with 1 damage item, EX: Mercury Treads, Righteous Glory, Titanic Hydra, Spirit Visage, Thornmail/Randuin's Omen, Gargoyle Stoneplate. All the bonus MR and Armor would synergize with her passive and E, and Spirit Visage would synergize with the regeneration half of her passive. She would probably fill a similar role/build to a Sion or Shen. Q is your basic mobility+stun, nothing special, but she can melt tanks with the % health if she gets the CD low. Passive W is especially good if you have a melee heavy team, Active W is basically Righteous Glory without the slow combined with Talon's parkour. Passive E gives her a bit of sustained damage, but it also synergizes with her passive, adding more damage to her basic attacks, it also helps with last hitting. E is her main source of damage, easily shredding tanks of their defenses for her team to kill. Her R doesn't really fit with her kit as a mobile team fight tank, but there isn't really anything else I can give to her as her ult, since Excalibur is her signature weapon and her noble phantasm that shreds basically anything it hits. It would be a mid-late team fight ult, ideally combined with cc for max potential, it can be used outside of vision, but during the channel enemies can see the light from it. She would **DEFINITELY** be OP in a tank meta. I don't see her being any good in an assassin or poke meta though.",leagueoflegends,0

No mana, lots of hp and ad, slow ms and as.

Passive : After receiving 33% of your max hp, channel dark magic, which gives you a 75% dmg reduction for the duration and will give you a dmg buff after it. The chanel will be stopped after losing additional 15% of your max hp, and if you succeed channeling, knockback and dmg enemies : 

Q : Flying Smash

Spin into the air and smash the ground, stunning enemies in it for 1 second. It has approx the same range as Gragas R and speed. 

W : Foul play 

Throw some oolacile dirt in a cone and dmg and slow enemies. 

E1 (hold it long) : Thrust slice spin

After channeling a little, thrust and dash, slice (First Seju W but bigger) and then spin like Darius does.

E2 (short ) : slice slice spin 

Both E's work like Rivens Q :

R : activate it once, and after every other activation cast a third Riven Q for a max of 3 times. 

Depending on the amount of castes you'll stun yourself for a period after the leap.

Maybe he would be op, since he got loooots of aoe cc, up to 5 dashes (if he uses each only once) and is completely immune to cc in each spell, but a quick Kog'Maw flash and reposition should kill him quickly, since he won't be able to chase a Kog after his passive gets triggered",leagueoflegends,0

Just because it's not fixed doesn't mean it's ignored. That's not how dev works either.

You prioritize issues. Odds are the jayce issue affected a tiny proportion of players. It's also not a game breaking bug, may or may not have been skin-specific, and only affects one champion. Jayce was also probably a relatively low pick rate champion at the time. All of this means that this bug is low on the priority list.

Tbh that sounds perfect.

I dont think you understand how big the difference between a brand new player who just hit 30 and your average bronze 3 player really is.

And you start off with low silver MMR in ranked (which is dumb)

I mean if you could go straight into ranked after hitting 30 you would get SHAFTED. hard.

You really do need those kind of hours or tbh more put into the game to be anything but a total fucking deadweight for your team when you first hit ranked.

150 hours is only 75 30 min games. assuming ~45% winrate for a brand new to the game player thats like 33-34 wins total @30. (and if you win more the time to gain those champs goes down massively)

>Riot has the exact same business model, the only difference being that they don't have anything that's directly pay to win anymore since they got rid of runes

Runes were the least pay 2 win thing in the game which is the reason they were removed lmao.

This is why I was impressed with the announcement that they were going to be removing runes. I thought they were a huge problem with time investment. Unfortunately, with this change, riot has decided to make currency harder to come by so that heros are bought with real money more often.

I understand this is a business and there needs to be incentive to spend money in order for salaries to get paid. But ...I strongly believe more people would buy skins if they were at a slightly lower price point or went on sale in people's personal shop more frequently.

BUT, even if this were possible, your math simply doesn't work out. I've made plots showing the Q, E, and R damage of Karthus as a function of opponent MR for a few builds:



 ItemSet 1 (Blue Line)| ItemSet 2 (Reddish/Orange Line) | Itemset 3 (Yellow Line)| ItemSet 4 (Purple Line)| ItemSet 5 (Green Line)
---|----|----|----|---
Rod of Ages (Stacked)| Rod of Ages (Stacked)|Rod of Ages (Stacked)| Rod of Ages (Stacked)| [nothing]
Zhonya's Hourglass | Zhonya's Hourglass|Zhonya's Hourglass | Zhonya's Hourglass| [nothing]
Void Staff| Void Staff| [nothing]| [nothing]|  [nothing]
Liandry's Torment| Liandry's Torment|Haunting Guise|Haunting Guise|  [nothing]
Sorceror's Shoes| Sorceror's Shoes| Sorceror's Shoes| Sorceror's Shoes| [nothing]
Rabadon's Deathcap| Sorceror's Shoes (a second pair) |Rabadon's Deathcap|Sorceror's Shoes (second pair)|  [nothing]

Notes:
- Itemsets 1 and 2 are potential end-game itemsets. 
- Itemset 1 has a Rabadon's; Itemset 2 has two pairs of Sorceror's shoes, as you suggest. 
- Itemsets 3 and 4 are potential itemsets for the Karthus in the gif above.
- Itemset 3 (Yellow Line) is the exact build this Karthus had.
- Itemset 4 is the build he would have if he didn't have Rabadons, but did have two pairs of Sorceror's shoes, as you suggest.
- Itemset 5 has no items.


I varied opponent MR between -20 and 200. -20 isn't really attainable, but I was curious. I applied percentage magic penetration before flat magic penetration, as advised on [this LoL Wikia page](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Magic_penetration) and calculated the damage multipliers as advised on [this LoL Wikia page](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Magic_resistance). I took the Karthus base damages and multipliers from [this LoL Wikia page](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Karthus). 

I did not take into account masteries. 

[Here](https://imgur.com/hsGcn6n) are the plots. I've put the Matlab script below, at the bottom of the post. 

The plot speaks for itself. 

- As an end-game Karthus, if you're hitting Qs, there is *no value of Opponent MR* where it is better to get a second pair of Sorceror's Shoes over a Rabadon's

- As an end-game Karthus, if you can't hit Qs and you're just doing damage with E, it is only advantageous to buy a second pair of Sorceror's shoes if your opponents have less than about 14 MR. 

- As the Karthus in the gif above, if you're hitting Qs, there *again* is *no value of Opponent MR* where it is better to have the second pair of Sorceror's Shoes over the Rabadon's.

- As the Karthus in the gif above (who admittedly had trouble hitting his Qs), his E will only do more damage to opponents with an MR less than about 8. If opponents have MR higher than 8, it is better to have the Rabadon's than a second pair of Sorceror's shoes.

You are wrong. If you still think you're right, go through and show me where my math is wrong. Otherwise, maybe try doing some math before calling everyone stupid next time.

Yeah shit tones of AP, unreachable, and all of this fuss just to get twice as much damage, foolish me...

>His E has a 20% fucking AP ratio and his ult has only a 60% ap ratio.

What ratio do you fucking expect on a spell that is damage per second and in most scenarios you deal damage with it for 4-5 seconds easily, so it's 80-100% AP dealt as damage. Like, have you fucking forgotten that this thing has no cooldown?  
And about his ult - people say that Shockwave has huge scaling with 70% AP ratio. It's only 10% more, it's not guarranteed to hit key target, and usually hits 2 or 3 people, one of them being AP/AD carry. How come is 60% of guarranteed damage to anybody on the map is worse...

>I didn't explain because I don't think people would be that stupid and not look at the actual numbers, but there ya go, can't really trust the league subreddit.

Yeah, also ""I troll because my tema bonobo"", and ""I will assume that you are wrong because you corrected me so I will look for a something that will let me stay inside my safezone instead of admitting mistake""

>Your numbers are completely out of fucking whack, there is no single moment where Karthus is dealing 160% ap ratio.
This isn't a moment, this happens in a course of 1 second, just as I wrote earlier.

>At most, he is dealing 80% in one second

You start combat with Q out of cooldown. If Zed can cast shurikens twice within 4 seconds, then he deals twice as much damage within 4 seconds. Rest doesn't matter because you can be already dead at this point, just as when karthus is up in front of your face.

>Also, before you go ""well according to sites karthus has a 60% winrate when he takes Rabadon's!"" Well no shit if Karthus reaches that point he's either an OTP or he got a really good lane matchup!

If this was bad item then rabadon would be a huge waste of advantage, but it's not, so he still has decent win rate with rabadon.

>It would take 430 AP to double damage dealt, not accounting for MR.

Yeah, because MR doesn't decrease base damage? Have I missed something?  
And before you go with hurr durr but muh magic pen - 15 magic pen will never double your damage, it will increase it by some percent about 10, vs tanks for even less. If there's any reason why flat magic pen is pretty good it's because W shreds magic resist by % value but it's only 15%.  ",leagueoflegends,0

I recommend a program called championify. It DLs builds from some of these sites and puts them into your game (allowed by Riot). When you look at your recommended items ingame you can select the builds from these sites via dropdown.

Before you buy an item always think about the situation you are in (who is fed on your team, who is fed on the enemies team, what is your role on the team and how are the teams going to play it out) before you buy something.

I'm sorry but your comment seems ridiculous in the context of discussing lower tier players mindlessly copying pro builds... 

Bronze/Silver players are there for a reason, you can't just say ""get better"" when we are talking specifically about lower divisions... The whole discussion revolves around the fact that lower tier players can't play a champion to it's full potential in most instances. 


I love that your ""solution"" is to play an easier champ even though I win more games than I lose building Tear on Orianna. 


If I was a Platinum+ players building Tear than maybe there's a real issue there, but like MOST players, I am not - I'm Gold, barely. And ""suboptimal builds"" have such a small impact on the outcome of games down here it's laughable to think somebody should just play an easier champ rather than adapting to a build path that they can be successful with.

If you’re playing for fun, sure do what you want.
If you’re playing to get better, improve and climb, then my statement stands in my opinion. It’s way more optimal in the long run to learn the game first and learn a champion second. Coaches would say the same to you. Builds may not matter in some cases at lower MMR since people there don’t have hands (/s). 
Since there is a lot of stuff to learn to be able to get better, piloting an easier champ allows you, as I stated, to focus better on that. 

You said that we’re talking about lower tier players not being able not being able to play a champion to full potential. That’s probably because they’re playing mechanically demanding champs, so I call back to my comment about a simple champ such as Annie.

I would imagine most people play a GAME to have fun, I certainly do. I also play to improve and try to slowly climb ranks. I am competitive when I play ranked.

I also used a 25% less xp modifier for bot games because I'm level 30 (33) and that's what I think it reduced.

20 Min Games:  
Bots (100% Winrate) (1 Min between games because bot games are found really fast)  
4.90 XP / Min  
Bots (100% Winrate) (2 Min between games)  
4.68 XP / Min  
PVP (50% Winrate) (5 Min between games)  
5 XP / Min  
PVP (50% Winrate) (10 Min between games)  
4.16 XP / Min  
PVP (60% Winrate) (5 Min between games)  
6 XP / Min  
PVP (60% Winrate) (10 Min between games)  
5 XP / Min  
PVP (40% Winrate) (5 Min between games)  
4 XP / Min  
PVP (40% Winrate) (10 Min between games)
3.33 XP / Min

30 Min Games:  
Bots (100% Winrate) (1 Min between games)  
4.93 XP / Min  
Bots (100% Winrate) (2 Min between games)  
4.78 XP / Min  
PVP (50% Winrate) (5 Min between games)  
5.31 XP / Min  
PVP (50% Winrate) (10 Min between games)  
4.65 XP / Min  
PVP (60% Winrate) (5 Min between games)  
6.37 XP / Min  
PVP (60% Winrate) (10 Min between games)  
5.57 XP / Min  
PVP (40% Winrate) (5 Min between games)  
4.22 XP / Min  
PVP (40% Winrate) (10 Min between games)  
3.7 XP / Min

50 Min Games:  
Bots (100% Winrate) (1 Min between games)  
4.94 XP / Min  
Bots (100% Winrate) (2 Min between games)  
4.84 XP / Min  
PVP (50% Winrate) (5 Min between games)  
5.58 XP / Min  
PVP (50% Winrate) (10 Min between games)  
5.11 XP / Min

If this is accurate enough to their real alg then this are my notes:  
In 20 Min PVP Games, 10% Winrate equals to 1XP / Min if the time between games is 5 Min  
In 20 Min Games, 100% Winrate vs Bots with 1 Min between games equals 49% Winrate PVP Games, thus probably making bots the *safest* way to grind xp  
The more games last the more BE you'll get per minute  
The most effective grind is on PVP Games, making them the longest they can be and having the higher winrate possible.  
Fun fact: If this chart is true, it would take a bot game of in between seven and eight hours to get a whole level of about 1200 xp.

I would like to see others charts and formulas tho",leagueoflegends,0

Even if it's highly correlated with intelligence, mobas tend to take too long to learn to be useful as a measure of cognitive ability.

/r/leagueoflegends/comments/7ddbcr/study_finds_link_between_high_lol_rank_and/dpx5itz/,"As a researcher at an R1 university, I wanted to chime in and give some additional information that will hopefully give people some perspective. The journal this was published in is a well-regarded general interest journal, and so the idea that reviewers and the researchers themselves wouldn't have considered such obvious and straightforward alternative explanations and confounders like age is absurd. The sample size comments that a lot of people have made are also totally misguided conceptually and, hilariously, reveal that they didn't even read past the first couple pages, since the paper actually reports the findings of two separate studies, the latter of which uses extremely large samples from several games. 

It's fine if people want to armchair about the topic of the study, but the vast majority of these comments reveal that people haven't read the paper (fair) and/or that they have no formal training in causal inference and statistics (also fair, this is a subreddit not a grad school seminar). There is not a single comment here that constitutes a serious criticism of the article's findings. 

**tl;dr: armchair redditors that don't do statistics and didn't read the paper are saying things that make no sense.**

EDIT: A lot of people are harping on the sample size issues. This is a power problem and decreases the likelihood of finding a significant correlation, it doesn't make the study invalid. Most research in modern cognitive psych is based on small samples of college students. There is nothing inherently problematic about small, unrepresentative samples from an inferential perspective. It merely limits the external validity of the findings and makes it less likely that a significant effect is detected. 

The extent to which these results would hold in a broader population is an important question but doesn't pose a problem for detecting a correlation in the sample these researchers are working with. Moreover, Study 2 uses a clever design to test an empirical implication of the higher IQ -> higher rank hypothesis for a much larger, representative sample and finds evidence consistent with this hypothesis. Equally as important, the FPS findings show that this relationship does not exist where we would probably not expect it to. This is a kind of placebo test in which you look at the effect of a treatment on an outcome for which you would expect a null finding and seems to me (although I haven't read the paper too closely) quite persuasive. The sample size for Study 2 is enormous (the League sample alone is 400,000) and appears to be a random draw from the ranked populations on the regions and games they analyze.

Im not sure this study was done with good statistics in mind. I would need to run it through minitab but I think that drawing conclusions about a population of millions from a selection of 56 players may be faulty. I Need to finish reading the study but I also question how they selected players because the players distribution does not match league distribution. So dont worry my bronze friends your IQ is not at risk.

Edit: reviewed their methods and samples and am confident this study has an exceptionally low confidence level and probably invalid due to bad statistics. First their selection of players is almost exlusively from college students which will skew data and reduce the true randomness of samples. Second, a sample size of 56 for a population in the millions is terrible. Third, they had no bronze players represented and the majority of their subjects were in plat the sample data needs to match the population distribution and it doesnt you cant select no bronze players while they make up 90 percent of the true population. Finally, I don't know what stat test they utilized but with this much bad data few tests would give anything close to a good result.",leagueoflegends,0

In terms of the other way around of does higher intelligence CAUSE higher rank? Well, no, going by real definitions it is not possible to establish causation for anything of this sort. 

Causation is a term reserved for definitive cause and effect. If I put more weight on one side of a scale without altering the other it will go down. By definition you can't find anything other than correlations when relating to league rank. There is no formula you can use no matter how many factors you include that get you to a specific rank. A person has B hours logged on the game with a reaction speed of C, an IQ of D, of age E, with F number of ranked games, playing G champions, putting in H level of commitment, with I emotional stability, on and on. That person could be challenger and they could be bronze. That doesn't mean number of hours logged on the game doesn't correlate well with rank. Correlations are valuable if the statistics are good.

I would agree with you but add that there's a big difference between correlations with two very unlikely things to match factors and correlations with two very likely things to match factors.  
  
Like it's obvious that there's an inherent nature that both intelligence and being good at LoL share so you can expect to be a higher chance at causation whereas two seemingly unrelated factors which are playing League and having testicles are just not expected to have a causation link.",leagueoflegends,0

> The correlation was found to be .40 which by definition is a very weak correlation

For a Pearson's product-moment correlation test, a result of r=0.40 is considered a moderate correlation. 

Here's something to help visualize it:

https://gyazo.com/eee542f6afe77d128a555668c793dd99


[Source](http://support.minitab.com/en-us/minitab-express/1/help-and-how-to/modeling-statistics/regression/how-to/correlation/interpret-the-results/)

Here's another quote:

>High degree: If the coefficient value lies between ± 0.50 and ± 1, then it is said to be a strong correlation.

>Moderate degree: If the value lies between ± 0.30 and ± 0.49, then it is said to be a medium correlation.

> Low degree: When the value lies below + .29, then it is said to be a small correlation

[source](http://www.statisticssolutions.com/pearsons-correlation-coefficient/)

Now, these boundaries are NOT absolute. If the population size is very large for example, an r value of 0.4 could mean your data is extremely correlated. 

I checked the actual study, which is [here](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0186621), and had some observations;

1. sample size is huge, 17,000 for league
2. Only 2 of the many 'intelligence tests' gave a significant result (alpha=0.05).

So, like most stats, it's strong in some areas and weak in others, and overall nothing conclusive can be drawn. A more robust measure of intelligence would probably give no correlation.",leagueoflegends,0
/r/leagueoflegends/comments/7ddbcr/study_finds_link_between_high_lol_rank_and/dpx1avv/,"that's... a very low correlation, just about the lowest you can get and still call it a correlation.

Whether this study has any merit or not, it's still extremely dangerous to propagate theories like this. Finding a study like this is only going to make the community more toxic at all ranks because people like so much to deal in absolutes- ""i'm plat I, you're plat V, listen to me because I'm a genius and you're retarded"".

1. I came to the same conclusion that the results are extremely strong.
2. I didn't say it was a weakness, just an observation which should be taken into account. i.e., when the title says ""intelligence"", they don't mean ""across the board"" intelligence, only very specific areas.

I think one of the biggest flaws in their methodology is that they didn't control for the number of games played. Their threshold for ""many games"" is only 100 ranked.

A silver player is much more likely to be on the lower side of the number of games played than a master tier player, and often times if you only have 100 games you aren't at your ""true elo"" (if you have a good win rate).",leagueoflegends,0

/r/leagueoflegends/comments/7ddbcr/study_finds_link_between_high_lol_rank_and/dpxa4cx/,"Being bad at League doesn't mean you're stupid, but I would bet a whole lot that being smart and actually wanting to become decent at League probably means you will be.  League, at its core, is mostly pattern recognition, which is pretty universally correlated with intelligence.  One might argue being good at pattern recognition is all being intelligent means.

If someone is smart and genuinely bad at League I'd say they must either have spaghetti mechanics, zero capacity for map awareness (situational awareness is more about mental limberness than being smart per se), or they don't *actually* apply themselves to becoming better.  Personally I think most people don't climb because they don't actually focus on improving so much as focusing on winning, which aren't the same.  Also, ya know, because it's a ladder and even if every single person improved tomorrow so drastically that *today* they'd be Challengers, there'd still be people stuck in Bronze because there always has to be a Lich King.

Then there's also the fact that being intelligent and knowledgeable are separate things, and degrees are more about the latter.  Acquiring knowledge can be made easier by *being* intelligent, but it's mostly about discipline and drive.  Having a degree puts you in a similar boat as a mechanic: it just means you have a specific extra body of knowledge to draw from.  How you *apply* the knowledge you have is what determines if you're intelligent or not.  There are incredibly intelligent car mechanics and incredibly average psychologists.  Or to put it in League terms, being knowledgeable means being a top laner and knowing it takes ~30 seconds to get back to lane and that you can all-in the enemy top and win handily, while being intelligent means seeing the jungler is bot side and timing it out so you jump them from the brush between their turrets.",leagueoflegends,0
/r/leagueoflegends/comments/7ddbcr/study_finds_link_between_high_lol_rank_and/dpxji58/,"Well for one thing, given that results are statistically significant, the ratio of sample size to population size is irrelevant unless the sample size is large enough that it is close to the population size, in which case a correction needs to be made when computing the standard error.  Secondly, he just says the sample size is too small without any reference to power analysis or the observed effect size.  The distribution of sampled ranks does not necessarily need to reflect that distribution in the overall population either for a correlation study (or even for other types of studies if oversampling is correctly applied).

From the paper itself: 

>The two studies presented here have very different sample sizes. For Study 1, N = 56. For Study 2, we have many thousands of data points. The two analyses therefore have different strengths and weaknesses. In Study 1, although N is small, the data are collected under controlled laboratory conditions using standardized instruments. Although the relatively small sample size cautions us that this work is still exploratory, the large effect size and strong significance are encouraging. The data from Study 2 are collected from larger cohorts but the provenance of each data point is less certain. Issues such as selection bias are potentially problematic and we expect to find some noise in measures such as age due to participants deliberately or carelessly reporting false information—although there is evidence that large web-based samples such as these can be relatively reliable [78]. The hope with large datasets such as these is that the huge number of participants more than compensates for the increase in noise caused by the sampling methods. An important challenge for future research is to test this assumption by broadening the use of validated tests to a wider subject group—perhaps through careful use of online crowdsourcing platforms.",leagueoflegends,0

How does a new player know what they want to play?  Wait potentially months for it to come on the free rotation?  I've discovered plenty of champions that I would have played for much longer had they not seemed so ""eh"" on paper, or at least relative to other champions I could have spent my IP on, but which turned out to really gel with me.  If you could play whatever you wanted from the get-go you'd actually *know* which champions you, ya know, want to play as your core roster.  And so what if someone only plays Lee Sin once in a blue moon?  Why shouldn't that option be available to them?  Why shouldn't they be able to just up and decide they want to play a champion and then play it?

>or if you expect the game to not make any money from people buying champions.

This is... exactly what I expect if Riot wants to be an honest company.  The champion grind is a manipulation tactic designed to dishonestly part people with their money through artificial inconvenience rather than offering a great product and extolling its virtues.  They make far and away enough money purely from their cosmetic sales that they have no *need* to engage with their consumers this way, but do so because they can get away with it and are greedy, and care more about squeezing every extra cent they can from their playerbase than anything else.

>But given that the game is free

Oh my fucking lord I'm legit going have an aneurysm with how often this is parroted.  ""Free-to-Play"" is a business model.  The game itself is not free in a genuine sense.  The game is a [loss leader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_leader) that draws in a consumer base and gives them a reason to purchase what amounts to Riot printing money with their cosmetics.  Whether you are a consumer player or a non-consumer player you are contributing to that business model by either being part of its marketing or both being part of its marketing and actually parting with your money to support the game.  The game itself *should* be free, and that's my issue because it's not under any definition that's reasonable.

>It would also remove the grind therefor the reason a lot of people play League, without the rewards for playing, a lot less would play daily and stay on the game forever.

Which can be supplemented through alternate means; there's tons of low-hanging fruit they could reach for to offer for the grinders.  Modify the champion leveling system so it's longer and unlocks different low tier cosmetic options specific to that champion.  Level 4, 5, 6, and 7 get you mastery emotes, but maybe 10 gets you a suite of emotes of that champion's face (like the Lux and Jinx ones) or related to that champion, and 20 gets you a profile splash, or whatever.  Profiles in general are rife for customization options that would be low-effort on Riot's part and could be offered for collectors and grinders.  This is just off the top of my head.  I imagine an actual team dedicated to this kind of thing could come up with *plenty* for people to work towards that Riot could part with for only in-game currency.

I definitely don't begrudge Riot making money, and I've happily parted with hundreds of dollars for them to put in their coffers.  When it comes to their honest business -- being their cosmetics -- I salute them.  Keep pumping those beautiful works of moving art out and I will keep dressing my virtual characters up.  What I *don't* like is dishonesty and greed.

Riot would still be wildly profitable solely relying on cosmetic sales, but like so many companies that have dipped their toes into this business model they see more and more opportunities if they just sacrifice being a company that doesn't actively, dishonestly manipulate their customers.  Honest business is making a good product, extolling its virtues, and making a fair transaction with the consumer.  That's their cosmetics and again I applaud them for that facet of their business.  Really, that *is* their business.  What I have a problem with is that they entered the ""Free-to-Play"" business model without ponying up on their end.  Their game is ""free"", but not actually *free* because core game content is locked behind a heinous grind that is designed to frustrate their customers enough that they'll pay for something that Riot can still claim is unpaid.  Rune pages are artificially limited for the same reason.  Hell, even the very existence of Riot Points is a manipulation.  Riot has the option to run a completely honest business using a legitimate model with the game serving as a loss leader for their skins but they don't.  They don't because their goal isn't to be wildly profitable or honest, but rather to squeeze every last dime out of their playerbase that can.  The IP>BE fiasco was based on mostly faulty data pointing to BE being worse.  It wasn't, and the hubub was mostly just people finally having a reason to step back and realize how shitty the system always has been, but I guarantee you the idea was floated to somehow cut champion acquisition rates with this shift, and was weighed against the potential backlash.  The only thing you can say about Riot is that they're smarter than a lot of companies pedaling this same bullshit, and understand that they need to at least maintain a certain level of player goodwill for long-term longevity.

And you can say all of that is their right, and it is.  But if Riot isn't going to be a fair company for its own sake then they've chosen the battleground.  If they're going to push for every last cent, the only rational response as consumers is to push for every last ounce of value we can.  This is why I don't get people who slam other players for ""being children who want free stuff"".  Uh, no.  *Riot* is the one, if anyone, acting like a child.  Taking cookies from the cookie jar until a rule is explicitly made to tell them not to.  Pushing for a model that siphons as much from us for as little in return until the outcry explicitly tells them ""this is the line"".  Given this we should be banding together as consumers to damned well get every last bloody free thing we can from them.  Riot chose this relationship, not us, and we can talk about being reasonable in our demands once *Riot* decides that being reasonable and fair is something that matters.",leagueoflegends,0

/r/leagueoflegends/comments/7ddb98/low_ground_advantage_explained_by_fnc_analyst/dpxbiud/,"Obi-Wan doesn't need to be on the high ground, the high ground just needs to exist in the battle; Obi-Wan knows that when he has the low ground, he really has the high ground, from a certain point of view. Look at his battle record:

Maul: Has low ground, wins

Dooku: No high ground, loses

Greivous: Has low ground, wins

Vader: Has high ground, wins

Vader rematch: No high ground, loses

Obi-Wan with the high/low ground is canonically the most powerful Jedi. This is fact. Had Yoda not denied his request with typical Jedi arrogance, he could have beat Palpatine in the Senate building, which housed a variety of different altitudes; this so that the Chancellor could always have the moral high ground in Senate debates. But Obi-wan didn't fight Palpatine, and Yoda soon learned that you can't cleave the Sheev in a normal 1v1.

As we all know, spinning is a good trick. However, only the Chosen one can spin outside of a starfighter. Palpatine tried spinning, but he lost (but this was intentional, as losing gave him the emotional high ground when Anakin arrived). The reason for this is that spinning provides a yin-yang approach (based in Eastern philosophy on balance), giving the spinner the high ground from above and below. This is why Obi-Wan was so emotional after defeating Vader on Mustafar; he expected to lose the high ground to the spin, but Anakin failed to maintain balance in the universe, symbolic of his fall to the dark side.

Anakin doesn't hate sand for the reasons he told Padme; all Jedi hate sand, as the battlefield can rapidly change between low and high ground. This is the only reason why Obi-Wan killed Maul in Rebels. This is also why Obi-Wan hates flying; in space, there is no high ground as there is no frame of reference from which there is a high or low ground, due to the lack of gravity.

In ANH, Vader proves his newfound mastery by engaging Obi on perfectly even ground. However, he lets himself die on the Death Star so that he could train Luke from a higher plane of existence.

(Why was Vader so invested in the construction and maintenance of the Death Star? Because he knows Obi-wan can't have the high ground if there's no ground left.)

In Return of the Jedi, you can see that the Throne Room contains a variety of different altitudes; Palpatine placed these there to ensure Vader's defeat. However, Sheev failed to realize that his weakness was no ground, and should have covered that gaping pit that does nothing.

In conclusion, Obi-wan abuses spatial relativity and Buddhist doctrine in order to invoke his high-ground powers.",leagueoflegends,0

The reason the chains hit at that range has nothing to do with the ""low ground"" it has to do with the fact that skillshots in league of legends ""balloon"" at the end of their travel so they technically have slightly longer range than the indicator shows. 

Also that with the LB example you gave that ""low ground"" had nothing to do with it, you used a dash that would have put you over 50% though the wall so it pushes you through to the other side. All movement abilities that dont get blocked by terrain do this.

Another example would be Thresh's hook, which I keep on normal cast. Better Thresh players would look for opportunities to hook someone through the gaps of a minion wave. Having the range indicator is useful in ensuring that you have enough of a gap before throwing your spell.

There are a lot of other examples and those are just a couple of them. Using smartcast exclusively does not give you the information you need to play a champion to its maximum potential.

Certain wall-based skills had strange interactions with this and would gain unlimited range (Anivia, Karthus). Similarly, you could path to negative or very high Z-values on the map to walk through walls.

I informed the dev team about these exploits and they were patched around the same time as packet encryption, but my point is that the game does take into account the Z axis for numerous interactions.

I've been playing gangplank a bunch and you will consistently get bonus gold, regen pots, And wards. Elixirs are pretty rare, And it's not enough to make his laning phase good. Ezreal is obviously overtuned with klepto atm. But rng in my opinion is good for this game over the long term. It's been a lot of the same predictable stuff for 7 years.

Add on to his more damage, he now gets more gold and can get to tear pickaxe really easily on his first back. His mid game damage is also better since he can get tear quicker and it now stacks faster. Manamune also stacks faster, so once he upgrades it to that, it isnt long til it is transformed. 

For reference before the tear/manamune changes, I would get a completed Muramana between 20-22 minutes on average. And it was really hard to get it before 20 minutes. After the changes, i can consistently get it around 17-18 minutes, one game i even got it transformed at 15 minutes.

/r/leagueoflegends/comments/7dd2vn/13_tips_to_get_better_at_league_of_legends/dpy6vbj/,"Hi there, great list.
One thing I don't really agree with is the 15cs= a kill. If you kill your opponent and make him lose 2 waves on xp and cs, it's much more worth than a few cs. Ofcourse: cs'ing is your main source of income. But killing the enemy AT THE RIGHT TIMING is very important. As a jungler, I often look which lane pushes in with a shitload of cs. I try to dive that lane or try to zone them away from the cs. If you can get your enemy's laners lose 1,5 wave, often your laners can use that to build up a lead which can result into a good freeze.

(I'm not maining a certain role, so I know every role's macro pretty good, so that's where my advise comes from)

Talking about freezing: as a jungler it's your duty to help break enemy freezes. F.E. the enemy toplaner has a perfect freeze: ward the toplane, go top just to push it out, which will lead in the minions being under your toplaner's turret in a minute or so. An addition to this: as a jungler, always help pushing out the lane where you just got a kill (except when your teammate(s) aren't planning on going B). This way your laner builds up a huge lead (mentioned before)

My last jungle-tip: not only you should gank to gain a lead, gank to tilt. Tilt is your friend if you know how to use it. When killing the toplaner level 3, go take scuttle crab, watch them teleport to a Minion and kill them. Works so often :)

TOPLANERS: DON'T TELEPORT TO A MINION IN THE MIDDLE OF YOUR LANE IF YOU JUST DIED TO A GANK!",leagueoflegends,0

Indeed, players should learn to prioritize farm, but a good mix between farm and smart kills is ofcourse best.

/r/leagueoflegends/comments/7dd2vn/13_tips_to_get_better_at_league_of_legends/dpxlahy/,"Think its one thing to ""know"" a fact its quite another to successfully incorporate it into your playstyle.

I often miss a valid strategy to take the knowledge and convert it into actual usefulness.    
Most guides say things like ""go to tutorial and practice cs"", 99% of those reading this wont do this and its then not actually a good advice if 99% ignore the way to make the knowledge useful.     
You also have not really explained how big a impact the cs have and not really sold the idea of it.

So think its not the fact of last hitting that is important the key thing to this advice is CONVINCING the reader how important it is and then motivate him to execute a strategy to improve.     

Good knowledge but im doubtful anyone actually improves by reading it",leagueoflegends,0

/r/leagueoflegends/comments/7dd2vn/13_tips_to_get_better_at_league_of_legends/dpx68g4/,"I really liked your guide, and agree with almost everything in it.  

However, the ""Objectives"" tip might be a little misleading.  The final four ranks, Red -> Blue -> Minions -> Kills isn't something that should be ranked linearly.  From these four things, there are many different factors on which is more valuable.  In lower elos, there is definitely an over prioritization of kills rather than objectives.  However, this linear ranking might mislead some that kills have less value than anything else.

A possible change might be to suggest that kills can lead to objectives, with the objectives themselves being the goal.  Similarly, you could mention different instances when one should prioritize farming or fighting.

No worries! Start with one thing at a time (getting every single last hit, no matter what). 
After sometime you develop a habit (last hitting without even thinking about it) and you can focus on the next thing (warding for example).",leagueoflegends,0
/r/leagueoflegends/comments/7dd2vn/13_tips_to_get_better_at_league_of_legends/dpxo5wi/,"Point taken. I can only speak for myself, but I learn by gathering as much information as I can and then trying to apply it to my gameplay. My intrinsic motivation to be better at the game drives me to do this. 

I‘m not sure how I can motivate someone who doesn‘t actually want to DO it. There is no shortcut for any skill in life. You need to be willing to do the hard work to get results. 

I practised my last hitting skills, by playing hours of boring custom games. No items, no runes, no skills. Was it boring? Yes! Annoying? Yes! Did I improve? Yes, and this is what counts (for me). 

League is a strategy game at it‘s core and to be good at it you need to be thinking about a lot of things at the same time. 

I agree that knowledge alone won‘t win you games. It might actually even hurt you at the beginning. This is why I personally think, that one should start with just one thing out of this list and focus only on that. (I used to only focus on farming during games, no roaming, no harrassing. Just focusing on getting as much farm as I can while not dying.)

After mastering one thing, move on to the next and so on.

If you check out some of my other guides, I go more in depth in trying to convince people. (You still have to take action yourself, I’m not standing behind your PC and spanking you if you don’t go in a custom game to practice CSing :D).",leagueoflegends,0
/r/leagueoflegends/comments/7dd2vn/13_tips_to_get_better_at_league_of_legends/dpxn7gy/,"I see your point, but the end goal of League of Legends is killing the Nexus. And you only get access to the Nexus by destroying an Inhibitor. You could have as many Barons as you like, if you never actually manage to destroy an Inhibitor, you lose the game. 

Also taking an Inhibitor is generally less risky, than Baron in Solo Q. Your team is less likely to get aced at an Inhib. 

Additionally, an Inhib can make it easier to take Baron. Having a pushing lane can threaten the Nexus turrets or even the open Nexus, by having Super Minions pushing in. The enemy team has to defend, while your team can secure (a free) Baron.

I'll give two examples of mid laners who can take Inspiration/Sorcery:

1 - Viktor: He can take Kleptomancy since Q-auto triggers it, Future Market in tough matchups to overcome his previously punishable back timings with first upgrade, then take something like Scorch/Transcendence for additional harass + 10% CDR.

* playing as Karma mid/support, hit about 60-70% of the time, maybe drops to 50% by late;
* playing as Vel'Koz support, very high hit rate, I had close to 90% for the first several minutes, then dropped to maybe 80% in mid game? Didn't follow it later;
* saw on Lux, she has CC on Q and E, so most of the time it should hit

But there are a lot of champions, who start don't start with much CC, unless they buy Rylai, but that's like forcing them into buying a suboptimal item. :/

Let them settle in and get comfortable in their new environment with their new teammates. This seems as if they think Korea is some hyperbolic time chamber that is the place you go if you want to speed up progression... when in reality you need to understand what bootcamping in Korea can do for you and have clear reasons/goals for going. 

So thinking of that, what can you accomplish in Korea right now that you can't in NA? You get better ping for solo q? Only makes sense to me if they want to try out some Korean prospects or if a majority of the other NA teams are planning on going as well. 

Scrim wise, they need to be just focusing on learning how to play together. They need to start agreeing on basics to the game, identifying weaknesses, determining their communication structure, and just learning each others tendencies and styles. None of that requires Korea. There will be plenty of teams in NA looking to scrim with their new rosters. You don't need to play against higher level teams right now to accomplish those goals. If anything, getting shit stomped in scrims will lower morale and confidence and make it really hard to work on the basics. In Korea you have to worry about accommodations, finding scrim partners with limited connections, living out of a suitcase, finding healthy food (much harder on the go and without being familiar with the area/language), etc. 

It is also beneficial, especially for a new team, to start developing relationships with good scrim partners. See which teams look the best or provide the best practice for your team. Go to Korea and all the other teams are filling their future scrim slots and developing relationships with teams they want to use as scrim partners throughout the season. As a new team, Optic may already have a tougher time getting scrim partners especially if their roster isn't seen as strong, so this may hurt their ability to get scrims even more.

/r/leagueoflegends/comments/7esq3h/zaboutine_romain_bigeards_interview_about_their/dq7dksb/,"I'll give you a proper translation. With formatting! I'm skipping the part before the actual interview. Might add it later during the day



**How did you arrive at OpticGaming?**

**Romain Bigeard(RB):** The team received founding from big investors (such as Neil Leibman, boss of Texas Rangers from the MLB) and they were looking for someone to get into League of Legends. They heard good comments about me, my ideas and it got done pretty quickly. 5 days after  having spoken with them via phone for the first time, I was in a plane headed to Riot HQ in order to convince them to choose OpticGaming for a spot among the 10 franchises in the league. My prescence helped their application given that there were about 100 applicants during the first round, still many during the 2nd round and Riot wanted to make sure that every team had at least 1 individual who truly knew LoL.

**Thomas «Zaboutine» Si-Hassen(Z):** I knew Bercy would be the biggest stage of my career as caster and that it would be difficult to make it bigger despite my love for it. Romain asked me if I would be interested in coaching a LCS team and I said yes without hesitation. Mostly because I've wanted to work with him for a long time : we are of a same mind concerning many subjects and he leaves me completely responsible of the game part



**At what point did it become a change of dimension?**

**Z:** The change of scale can give you vertigo since we're the 1st generation being thrusted into franchising. Given the partner and investors we have, the presence from the NBA, it's impossible to assess how much visibility will change.  We're with OpTic, who has over 3M twitter followers. Even before having a team in League of Legends, Overwatch or DotA. It truly is a challenge. Its like going from high-school where you thought you were good at maths to pre-college (The french have an intermediary school between high-school and college). You take a seat, thinking you're good at this and after 25 mins you understand that you're no longer playing the same game.

**RB:** OpTic is building an empire. Esports, as a whole, has been identified, notably by NBA teams,  as an investment that pays back. There are many players that want to take control of the field and they invest considerable amounts of money to solidify their spot among the 1st ones with a foot on the market. Its a global change and we're lucky enough to be in the front seat. Today, we have the scale of the staples of traditional sports with 7 figures budgets at our disposal. And the market is telling us that its not as big as our adversaries expected it to be. 


**The transfer period just started, I'm assuming that's priority number one? I'd imagine it's also harder to start from zero when facing TSMs and C9s who have been there for years?**

**RB:** It's more work because most teams already have the players but also training facilities and staff... we have a budget, we're placed against the other teams, we gave offers and given the feedback we'll receive we will build our structure. Our objective is to have 5 players before the weekend and we'll go to Korea and we'll be back before the holidays. And the season will begin. We might end up with a less team that is, on paper, less fascinating than those of other orgs but we'll be able to push them to the max.

**Z:** We're 100% in. We have a 15man short-list around which we want to build a team. But the real question is: Which players are we going to sign from NA and which player we'll be importing, given that we're bound by the rules that impose 3 locals and 2 imports. We have to build with that.



**So, Romain, are you keeping that fantastic touch that made you unique in Europe?**

**RB:** I don't know! Becoming the mascot for UOL was the product of many months of work. I'm guessing that in the USA, if you win, you can do whatever you want. If the results are there the attention will turn towards us and if the chance presents itself I'll take it. Will I end up half-naked in the scene? Maybe, maybe not.
