> The agreement—signed by Amy Dacey, the former CEO of the DNC, and Robby Mook with a copy to Marc Elias—specified that **in exchange for raising money and investing in the DNC, Hillary would control the party’s finances, strategy, and all the money raised. Her campaign had the right of refusal of who would be the party communications director, and it would make final decisions on all the other staff.

> Within hours after the American public found out that his most senior campaign official was under an indictment that described him as a secret agent of Russian interests, President Trump declared on Twitter: “There is NO COLLUSION!” A forceful statement if there ever was one. But what exactly was he denying so categorically? We have no idea.

> For one reason or another, “collusion” has become the term of choice for discussing what the Trump campaign may or may not have done with Russians. Those in the Trump camp use it regularly: “I did not collude, nor know of anyone else in the campaign who colluded, with any foreign government,” Jared Kushner told Congress this summer. “I did not collude with any foreign government,” Donald Trump Jr. said. “I deeply resent any allegation that I would collude with the oppressive Russian state,” the Republican strategist Roger Stone harrumphed.

> It isn’t just those in the Trump camp, though, who have settled on using this word. Among the first to refer to collusion was John Podesta, Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman, who raised the specter on “Meet the Press”: “I would argue that there’s very, it’s very much unknown whether there was collusion.” In that same week, Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, said of Trump campaign connections to WikiLeaks, “So there is collusion there, clearly.” The term has been a touchstone ever since.

> Mr. Trump and his inner circle have benefited enormously from this coalescing around the word “collusion” — a term with a legalistic feel but with close to “no legal meaning whatsoever” said Renato Mariotti, a former federal prosecutor and now a defense lawyer who has written a dissection of every public statement that a Trump associate has made to congressional investigators. If we care about the law — and about holding public figures accountable for their false denials — the impassioned disavowals of collusion by members of the Trump circle mean nothing. Donald Trump Jr.’s utterances to Congress, for example, were “not denying that he committed a crime,” Mr. Mariotti said. “Whether his denial is broader or more narrow than that depends on what exactly is meant by ‘collude’ in this statement — which we don’t know.”

> What might the term “collusion” actually mean? Mr. Mariotti and I may disagree on a small technicality; it does have some legal meaning. It is found in one place in the federal code, in the area of antitrust law, concerning practices such as price-fixing. But that’s no help. To transpose the antitrust framework onto issues of election interference would require metaphor gymnastics.

> Outside the legal definition, collusion might mean something along the lines of conspiracy and complicity. And we should not care only about whether Mr. Trump’s actions were inside or outside the boundaries of the law. The impeachment clause of the Constitution certainly doesn’t (you can be impeached for violating the public’s sacred trust without committing a crime). The sheer offensiveness of the action is what’s more important.

> But the integrity of even this idea has been degraded by the ready mixing of the term with legal concepts (notions of “proof” of collusion and ideas of “criminal collusion”).

> The problem is that the focus on the term “collusion” has had the effect of implying precision where there is essentially none. Meeting the standard of “proof of collusion” isn’t a matter of meeting a technical definition or threshold — it is a matter of persuading enough people that what we’re seeing is collusion. It is, in other words, a political judgment and, as with all things political, is extraordinarily subjective and vulnerable to all sorts of manipulations. The fuzziness of the current discourse may not matter much to the F.B.I., whose investigation will surely adhere to the letter of the law — but it might matter a great deal for how its findings play in the court of public opinion.

> The use of the word has, for instance, allowed members of Congress handling the Russia investigation to tell us that they have not seen a scintilla of evidence of “collusion.” We now know that these congressional members had long been told by American intelligence officials that advisers to Mr. Trump might be working with the Russians to interfere in the election. That’s what use of the word “collusion” helped keep hidden

> The term’s elusiveness has also allowed for an easy shifting of goal posts. Back in June, Mr. Trump took to Twitter to say that President Barack Obama was the one who “colluded” with the Kremlin to interfere with the election. When a reporter pressed the question — “what evidence does he have that President Obama was colluding?” — the White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, responded that Obama insiders “knew about it and didn’t take any action.” If that were the standard for collusion, then if people on Mr. Trump’s campaign were aware of Russian possession of stolen emails and did nothing, they’d have no defense against allegations of collusion. But they do — because the term comes with no consensus as to its definition.

> We have now surely lost touch with any reasonable sense of what “collusion” means. If we, as a country, knew a year ago what’s now understood to be an avalanche of well-reported facts, published emails and legal documentation, the behavior of the president’s family and associates would have crossed any reasonable line of what might be meant by an attempt to collude with the Kremlin.

> Mr. Trump might have won anyway without Vladimir Putin’s help. That’s not the issue. The issue is that the behavior of Mr. Trump and his associates amounts to a deep offense against the public’s sacred trust. We need to reckon not only with that fact, but also with how as a nation, we’ve almost lost the sense to recognize it.

>Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that a special counsel should be appointed by the Department of Justice to investigate:

>* then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch directing Comey to refer to the investigation into the handling of classified data and use of an unauthorized email server by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton as a matter, rather than a criminal investigation;
* Comey's leaks to Columbia University law professor Daniel Richman regarding conversations between Lynch and President Trump and how the leaked information was released to lead to the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller;
* the propriety and consequence of immunity deals given to Cheryl Mills, Heather Samuelson, John Bentel, and potentially others by the FBI during the criminal investigation into Clinton's conduct;
* Comey's decision to usurp Lynch's authority in announcing that criminal charges would not be brought against Clinton regarding her use of a private email server and handling of classified information;
* Comey's knowledge and impressions of any ex-parte conversation between Lynch and former President Bill Clinton on June 27, 2016, at a Phoenix airport on a private jet;
* Comey's knowledge of the company Fusion GPS and its creation of a dossier on Donald Trump;
* any potential leaks by Comey to author Michael Schmidt dating back to 1993;
* Comey's knowledge of the purchase of a majority stake in Uranium One by Rosatom;
* Comey's refusal to investigate Hillary Clinton regarding selling access to the Department of State through Clinton Foundation donations, Huma Abedin's dual employment at such entities simultaneously, or utilization of the State Department to further paid speaking opportunities for her husband;
* any collusion between Comey and Robert Mueller;
* whether Comey had any knowledge of efforts made by any federal agency to monitor communications of then-candidate Donald Trump, to assess Comey's knowledge about the unmasking of individuals on Donald Trump's campaign team, transition team, or both, to assess the role that former National Security Adviser Susan Rice played in the unmasking of such individuals, or to reveal the purpose served by unmasking any individuals serving on the staff of Donald Trump; and
* whether Comey had any knowledge of the dissemination of unredacted information to various intelligence agencies and of any attempts to use surveillance of Donald Trump to damage the credibility of his campaign, presidency, or both.",politics,0

Nothing in there about picking communications directors.
And let's face it, even if the Clinton campaign did have that power, would it make a difference? The DNC is an attack dog and a fundraiser. They were out of money, so Hillary bailed them out and put them on a fiscally responsible path. Appointing a communications director seems like the least they could do.

>The DNC is an attack dog and a fundraiser. They were out of money, so Hillary bailed them out and put them on a fiscally responsible path. Appointing a communications director seems like the least they could do.

But does that make it right? Is that how we want our political parties to work? Just because this *is* how something happened and *is* how it works does not mean that is how it *should* work.

Rigged:

4. to manipulate fraudulently:

Well that could be useful. How about we check what fraud is?

Fraud:
Noun:
1. deceit, trickery, sharp practice, or breach of confidence, perpetrated for profit or to gain some unfair or dishonest advantage.

So as far as the words actually mean, legality doesn't have to come into play. Because we're dealing with words and concepts like 'unfair' and 'dishonest advantage', I think it's fair to say that what happened qualifies as fraudulent. Precedent doesn't allow for the timeline of how Clinton got to control the finances of the DNC. Precedent should have had her only get only *after* she was the DNC's nominee.

Bowe Bergdahl, who in 2009 walked off a U.S. military outpost in eastern Afghanistan and spent the next five years in enemy captivity, was sentenced Friday to a dishonorable discharge from the Army but will avoid prison time.

>Bergdahl, 31, pleaded guilty in October to charges of desertion and misbehavior before the enemy and had faced a maximum life sentence.

>The case sparked ferocious debate over his actions and the controversial prisoner exchange that led to his release in 2014, challenging the military’s bedrock principle of never leaving a soldier behind. It was also overshadowed by President Trump’s accusation that Bergdahl is a traitor.

>Bergdahl will also lose all benefits, including medical care, afforded to military veterans. He’ll also pay a fine of $1,000 a month for the next 10 months.

I'm not saying we shouldn't.  I'm just saying that it would need to be done through the constitutional procedure for impeaching a justice.  There is no law that automatically voids prior votes by Senate if some congressmen are found to be criminals.  

There have been many cases of a congressman going to jail for crimes committed.  That doesn't make their votes before conviction voided.

Senate as a body confirmed Gorsuch.  It can also remove him if they so decide.  But there is no automatic removal because the President is impeached or even if Senators get removed.",politics,0
/r/politics/comments/7ajvg3/dem_senator_should_a_54_decision_with_gorsuch_in/dpaj5tm/,"Well, firstly, I think its a bit ""optimistic"" to put it lightly to think any senator is getting charged with conspiring.  And criminal acts by a member of congress don't nullify all votes they participated in - congress can't retroactively remove a person from congress.  For example, there have been congressmen in the past that ended up charged with crimes (e.g. Tom Delay among others).  But that didn't affect the votes they participated in before that time.  The constitution provides a way of removing people from office.  

The answer is nothing happens.  Even if a dozen senators get charged with conspiring with Russia or any criminal act, there is no law that nullifies their previous votes.  All that matters in terms of confirmation is that as a legislative body, Senate confirmed him.

I'd say there are more important issues that trying to impeach him which would never pass congress with the needed votes - like making sure he is in the minority of the court in the future.

[Here's a site to peruse what I'm getting at.](http://www.thirty-thousand.org/)

The short of it is, in the early 20's, surprise surprise, the Republican controlled Congress arbitrarily capped the number of representatives at 435.

The original ideal for the number of congressmen to constituents was one congress representative per 50,000 people. When people talk about states like Wyoming having a higher weighted vote, it really boils down to the this fact: there should be around 6000 congressmen to account for accurate representation.

/r/politics/comments/7ak3ba/inequality_is_a_bigger_threat_to_our_democracy/dpaj4jj/,">A large (and growing) body of evidence suggests that Russian agents aided the campaign of an American presidential candidate, in hopes of furthering their own special interests — and, perhaps, gaining a sympathetic ear at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. In pursuit of this end, the Kremlin disseminated mendacious propaganda over American social media and cable news, while using stolen emails to discredit their preferred candidate’s opponent. It’s possible that Putin might have even explored leveling an attack on our electoral infrastructure itself — thereby directly barring some Americans from having their voices heard at the ballot box.

>In a liberal democracy, the legitimacy of a state is founded on the integrity of its elections. Spread doubt about the latter, and the former starts to fall away. If Americans believe that their leaders do not derive their power from the popular will, but merely from the favor of shadowy puppet-masters, then civic engagement and social trust will decay. Voter participation will decline, along with confidence in public institutions. And these developments will, in turn, make it easier for bad actors to manipulate the democratic process. Eventually, cynicism about democracy could make some voters welcome the prospect of authoritarian rule. This is why it’s so vital that Russian interference in our elections is investigated and deterred.

>That’s also why Congress must not pass President’s Trump’s regressive tax cuts.

>That may sound like a non sequitur. The debate over tax policy in the United States is generally framed as a conflict between rival economic theories. Democrats may claim that cutting taxes on the rich will slow the economy, or drive up the debt, or force cuts to popular domestic programs. But few would put supply-side cuts on a list of threats to liberal democracy in the United States.

>And yet, the idea that increasing economic inequality and sustaining popular sovereignty are incompatible endeavors wasn’t always alien to our politics. In fact, as the Roosevelt Institute’s Marshall Steinbaum recently noted, the New Deal reformers who brought robustly progressive taxation to the United States understood the policy as a means of altering the distribution of power in society. That the rich can easily convert their wealth into political dominance was a common-sense proposition for Americans born into a Gilded Age. Thus, the point of confiscatory top marginal rates wasn’t to maximize efficiency or growth — but to limit the monied elite’s capacity to shape the American political economy to their whims.

>This argument for soaking the rich is just as salient now as it was in the robber barons’ heyday: In 2016, American billionaires aided the campaigns of their preferred presidential candidates, in hopes of furthering their special interests — and perhaps, gaining a sympathetic ear at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. In pursuit of this end, well-heeled donors funded propaganda campaigns through social media and television advertisements, while a few sought to use stolen emails to discredit their preferred candidate’s opponent. Some right-wing plutocrats even financed efforts to impose voting restrictions and felon disenfranchisement laws — thereby directly barring some Americans from having their voices heard at the ballot box.

>Some may take exception to this (implicit) analogy: American elites attempting to influence our elections through political speech — and Russian operatives trying to do so through cyberattacks — are categorically different phenomena. This is certainly true; but it also does nothing to negate the premise that the political influence of American multi-millionaires, billionaires, and corporations undermines the integrity of our democracy, in many of the same ways that Russian interference does.

Or that Sputnik has had a more corrosive influence on American discourse than Robert Mercer’s Breitbart?

The link is on that thread.

Nothing in there about picking communications directors. And let's face it, even if the Clinton campaign did have that power, would it make a difference? The DNC is an attack dog and a fundraiser. They were out of money, so Hillary bailed them out and put them on a fiscally responsible path. Appointing a communications director seems like the least they could do.

Moreover, the Sanders campaign also had a JFC with the DNC, but they never utilized it, because Sanders didn't have an interest in fundraising for the DNC or their candidates.

I fully expect that should the investigation go there, that Mueller will either recuse or chinese-wall himself off from whoever's investigating that.

I also fully expect that the investigation will not go there, because the deal has absolutely nothing to do with collusion in the 2016 election or Russian money laundering (the latter tends to be off the books, not in plain sight).

>Trump called the 2016 sitdown with his foreign policy advisers a “very unimportant meeting” and said he doesn’t “remember much about it.”

>Trump’s claim comes as a former campaign adviser says the President listened as adviser George Papadopoulos presented the idea of a meeting with Russian president Vladimir Putin.

>“He heard him out,” J.D. Gordon, a campaign national security adviser who attended the March 31, 2016 meeting, told CNN Thursday.

>Attorney General Jeff Session reportedly shut down the idea.

>Papadopoulos has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI and is cooperating with special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into possible collusion between Trump’s campaign and Moscow to disrupt the presidential election, according to court documents.

>All I can tell you is this, there was no collusion, there was no nothing,” Trump said Friday as he left for a 12 day trip to Asia. “It’s a disgrace frankly that they continue.”

>Addressing the meeting, of which Trump tweeted a photo at the time, the President said his memory was a little fuzzy.

>“I don’t remember much about that meeting,” hye said. “It was a very unimportant meeting. Took place a long time -- don't remember much about it.”

>Last week, Trump touted his mental prowess during a press conference on the White House lawn and tried to discredit the widow of a slain Army sergeant.

>Trump, pointing to his temple, said his account of a phone call between the two was correct because he has “one of the great memories of all time.”

Her courting of White Supremecists in the Charlottesville riots and in the White House itself were particular low points. She has alienated our closest allies and made friends with strongarm dictators who had American protesters beaten in the streets of our Capitol! She shouldn't spend another minute in the White House with the nuclear codes!

So from the time you are born to the time you die, your dollar is going to lose seventy-five percent of its value. That is at two percent inflation.

It is not a matter of how much less the dollar is worth, but rather, what percentage of dollars the various ""quintiles"" or the top one percent or the poorest have. 

It also matters who are the creditors or debtors and what interest rates are compared to inflation.

It also matters how the dollar compares to other currencies in international trade.

Why, when those dollars become worth less and less every day just as our wages do?

False. I am not talking about taking out a loan. The currency by design makes your dollar worth less every day. And that is transferred to bankers that print the new money daily too. It's a currency designed to make bankers rich at our expense. It's not needed.

Which just means you are cheating other people.

And are our wages buying more or less? Are houses the same price for a wage 30 years ago? No.

Totally false. The Industrial Revolution, the single greatest improvement for the quality of life, was not done on a debt based currency.

But I’m the President of the United States, and I won’t have a country that is run by a bought Congress. So I’m not going to work with a bought Congress and try to be Mr. Big Guy ... I’m going to abandon the bought Congress like Teddy Roosevelt did, and I’m going to go to the people of the United States get rid of the bought Congress.” ... Until a President says that’s the problem and says he’s going to fix it, there is no policy that I can possibly see no matter how brilliant your idea may be or your idea or my idea or her idea or your idea at home, is that idea will not happen as long as there’s a capacity to basically fire a politician who disagrees with me by taking funding away from him.

Essentially everything he's done are things he has unilateral authority to launch. And even of those things, several of them are tied up in bitter legal battles over their constitutionality -  like the travel bans. 

Trump is essentially the worst kind of executive - he only wields its power in the most crude and vicious way he can imagine, without bothering to stop and use influence to actually build meaningful policy.

Clinton campaigned against it too. It was dead either way.

>the Paris Agreement

Yeah, I'm really proud of that one. The US is now the only country  not part of this agreement. American exceptionalism indeed.

>dear colleague part of Title IX

Technically that was DeVoss, but I'll concede this is a good one.

> defeating ISIS

Not even remotely true. ISIS was being defeated for years. They were on their last legs when Trump took office. All he did was accelerate the process by giving the US Military carte blanche to bomb the crap out of Iraq, killing record numbers of civilians. He also abandoned US allies in Syria, and allowed Assad to stay in power. So yeah, ISIS is defeated, but US influence in the region has been tremendously weakened in the process - all to accelerate something that was already inevitable.

>multiple travel bans

All blocked by the Courts for being unconstitutional. Trump keeps updating them to render the injunctions moot.

>refugee vetting

There was already refugee vetting. Trump actually hasn't changed the vetting process yet - he just likes to say ""extreme vetting"" a lot to make you think he has.

>approving the pipelines

He approved a pipeline, yes.

>overturning the navigable waters rule

Yes, let's celebrate more pollution water sources!

> expediting environmental reviews for infrastructure

If by expedite, you mean ""cut"" or ""eliminate"".

>border wall prototypes

Not a wall, and Mexico sure isn't paying for it. Mexicans were net emigrating when Trump took office, so the Wall actually keeps people IN, not OUT. Also, nevermind that the majority of illegal immigration doesn't involve walking across the border.

>beefed up ICE

Whatever that means.

>lobbying ban

You really need to read this:
https://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/trump-lobbying-ban-weakens-obama-ethics-rules-234318

>a bunch of minor regulations

You don't get to say ""he cut regulations"" like it's a good thing. Pick a regulation, and say it was bad. Many regulations are good regulations, and cutting them would be bad.

>opioid commission

You can't be serious. Trump hasn't done a THING on this issue. He declared a public health emergency, but offered no money to do anything. He's given opioids some lip service, but hasn't accomplished a single thing.

>some trade deals and tariffs

No new trade deals. Tariffs have been made by breaking trade deals with neighbours and allies, and tariffs lead to trade wars - not economy growth

> This puts him at odds, a bit, with some of the more energetic segments of the Democratic base. Buoyed by the candidacy of Bernie Sanders, they have rallied around bold, universal economic policies like single-payer health care, free college tuition and a trillion-dollar infrastructure program. Universal programs of this sort, their advocates would argue, are less vulnerable to political attack than targeted programs, which conservatives have used racially coded rhetoric to smearas handouts. 

> For a contingent of leftists, this is a matter of first principles. People’s material conditions are the driver of historical change, they maintain, and organizing white and black working people under the banner of class solidarity is the only real route to eradicating racism. For these reasons they tend to eschew solutions that are narrowly tailored to the specific disparities in living standards experienced by marginalized communities. 

> But race-blind, universalist solutions can’t address the unique challenges of marginalized communities, according to powell. His list of “structures,” or axes along which different people can be privileged or oppressed, includes race, gender, sexual orientation and immigration status. He also considers largely white communities with pervasive, multigenerational poverty, such as those in Appalachia, to be marginalized groups in need of customized policy solutions.

> Universal programs “don’t address inequality and in some sense, squander resources,” powell said. “Targeted universalism can avoid some of that. Actually it can avoid a lot of it.”

Sure, targeted universalism is well and good - _if you can sell it to the people_. The problem is, _most voters aren't minority_ - and they can plant their foot and say, ""you're institutionalizing racism, I won't stand for that"".

(Since the election, Sater's links to Russia have come under scrutiny as it's been revealed that he offered, in 2015, to broker a relationship between Trump and Russian president Vladimir Putin—one that he said could win Trump the White House. ""I will get Putin on this program and we will get Donald elected,"" Mr. Sater wrote to Trump's lawyer.)
Publicly, Trump has long sought to distance himself from Sater—even testifying in a 2013 deposition that he wouldn't recognize Sater if the two men were in the same room together. On election night, they would have a chance to test that proposition.

If he doesn't call it torture, and the person who signed off on torture as long as it had a 'fake name' still gets confirmed, what was the point in his objection? 

Torture is illegal under US and international law, and McCain insisting on using the bullshit term they used to create a legal loophole is perpetuating the cycle. 

McCain also rehashes the primary legal loophole that the memos used with this sentence:

>interrogation techniques that violate the Geneva Conventions 

The Bush lawyers could not find *any* legal loopholes for violating the US-signed and ratified Convention Against Torture, or [18 U.S. Code § 2340A - Torture](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2340A), which prohibits any US government agents or officials from torturing anyone anywhere outside of the United States

Instead, they just pretended the above treaty and statute didn't exist and the torture memos cited the Geneva Conventions which had a big fat loophole which said prisoners of war had to be wearing uniforms when captured, and didn't detail *exactly* what torture is, loopholes that don't exist in the UNCAT.

/r/politics/comments/7boqtm/trump_should_give_thanks_not_take_credit_for/dpjlq46/,"In the year since Donald Trump was elected president, the economy and markets have been on a roll. Stocks have set one record after another, unemployment has dropped sharply and the U.S. enjoyed its strongest six months of economic growth since 2014.

Mr. Trump thinks he knows why: “The reason our stock market is so successful is because of me,” he declared earlier this week.

But Mr. Trump should be giving thanks, not taking credit. The entire global economy is picking up steam, and foreign stocks are outperforming American markets. This suggests the U.S.’s good fortune is due less to Mr. Trump’s presence than to a broader, global trend. Years of highly stimulative monetary policies by central banks have finally overcome various postcrisis headwinds holding back growth.

So Mr. Trump is a lucky man. The question is, can he make his luck last? That will require translating what may be a short-lived upswing into permanently faster growth, and as the fight over U.S. tax cuts demonstrates, that is no easy task.

The U.S. Catches a Global Tailwind

Growth and stock prices in other major economies have outperformed the U.S. since last fall.

The disappointing pace of global growth over the past decade reflects both structural drags such as aging populations and the headwinds that followed the U.S. financial crisis in 2008 and Europe’s sovereign debt crisis in 2012. Central bankers responded to both with bond buying and zero interest rates.

That monetary medicine circulated slowly because banks were focused on working through their bad loans and complying with new rules rather than lending. The process was over in the U.S. and still under way in Europe when another shock hit in 2015: a collapse in the price of oil and an abrupt slowing in China.

By last year, most of those shocks had receded. Oil recovered, especially after production cuts by OPEC and Russia shortly after Mr. Trump’s election. China reopened the credit taps.

Ethan Harris of Bank of America Merrill Lynch notes in a recent report that monthly business activity indexes in the U.S. and globally bottomed out in February 2016, and have been rising since. He says growth in China, the eurozone and Japan this year has exceeded both economists’ expectations and those countries’ long-term potential growth rates.

The markets mirror this pattern. Blue chip shares are up 21% in the U.S. since election day last year, 22% in France, 28% in Germany, 34% in Japan and 26% in emerging markets.

Of course, global growth and markets have always been linked, through trade and investor attitudes. Sometimes that’s because the rest of the world is hitching a ride on a U.S. boom.

This time, though, there’s a better case the reverse is happening. Japanese and European growth this year has been driven heavily by consumer spending and business investment, not exports.

By contrast, U.S. exports have grown faster than imports, with that gap contributing on average a quarter of a percentage point to growth each quarter this year. The dollar rallied after the election and then slid steadily as investors upgraded prospects for the rest of the world faster than for the U.S. and reallocated capital accordingly.

The stock market initially soared after Mr. Trump’s election as investors justifiably anticipated looser regulation, especially of banks, and lower taxes. Yet with time, the “Trump trade” has faded.

A basket of stocks tracked by Goldman Sachs of the highest-taxed companies outpaced the overall market for the first month after the election and has since underperformed; it’s up 17% in the past year, less than the total market. Goldman says that’s because multinationals, which tend to have the lowest tax rates, also benefit most from the lower dollar.

Why Trump Chose Powell as New Fed Chair
President Donald Trump formally nominated Jerome Powell as the next Federal Reserve chairman, meaning no second term for current Chairwoman Janet Yellen. WSJ's Jon Hilsenrath explains why Mr. Trump decided to choose a new leader for the central bank. Photo: Getty
So why is the market up so much? The overall economy “was better than markets realized this time last year,” says Charles Himmelberg, Goldman’s co-chief markets economist. “It was a little bit of a happy coincidence that markets started to fully price the strength of that macro data when Trump got elected.”

So Mr. Trump has been lucky. Still, successful presidents make their own luck, which is why Mr. Trump last week nominated Federal Reserve governor Jerome Powell to take over from Janet Yellen when her term as central bank chairwoman ends in February. Short of reappointing Ms. Yellen, it was the closest he could come to maintaining her strategy of raising interest rates gradually and cautiously.

Mr. Trump has promised to return the U.S. to sustained 3% growth through less heavy handed regulation and lower taxes, to encourage capital spending and innovation, and renegotiated trade agreements. His officials were proud to note the economy hit that annualized rate in the second and third quarters of this year.

The problem is that pace of growth isn’t sustainable. It required employers to add so many more workers that the unemployment rate dropped 0.4 percentage point. Keep that up and the labor market is going to run out of people.

That would finally make the Fed nervous enough about inflationary pressure to pick up the pace of interest rate increases, withdrawing the monetary medicine that got the current global upswing started.",politics,

""The court strongly feels that the minor children will be detrimentally affected by the present lifestyle of [Mrs. Borden] who has engaged in a homosexual relationship during her marriage, forbidden both by the laws of the State of Alabama and the Laws of Nature,"" Moore wrote in his ruling.
>
. . . Ultimately, the Court of Civil Appeals agreed with Borden and her attorney's that Moore should be taken off the case.

> Moore, then a circuit judge, was ultimately removed from the case by an Alabama appeals court after the woman and her attorneys argued that he couldn&#039;t be impartial because of his views on homosexuality, according to public court documents reviewed by CNN&#039;s KFile.

> The case took place years before Moore garnered national attention for his public battle over a Ten Commandments statue and his more recent refusal to enforce the Supreme Court&#039;s ruling allowing same-sex marriage nationwide, both of which resulted in Moore&#039;s removal from the Alabama Supreme Court.

> In January 1996, Moore was presiding over a divorce case between Suzanne Scott Borden and her estranged husband.

/r/politics/comments/7btdsr/prosecutors_seek_plea_deal_with_manaforts_former/dpkkduq/,"The Justice Department is seeking to reach a plea deal in its criminal investigation of the former son-in-law of Paul Manafort, President Donald Trump’s one-time campaign chairman, according to people familiar with the matter.

The investigation into Jeffrey Yohai—who hasn’t been charged with any crime—by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and U.S. attorney’s office in Los Angeles is separate from the Washington-based probe of his former father-in-law and others by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is examining Russian influence on last year’s presidential election, some of the people familiar with the situation said.

Mr. Manafort was accused by Mr. Mueller in an indictment unsealed Oct. 30 with using a network of shell companies in the U.S. and abroad to avoid taxes and launder money, and with lying to investigators and defrauding banks on real-estate transactions. He pleaded not guilty.

Although those charges didn’t appear to directly relate to Mr. Mueller’s investigation of whether Mr. Trump’s campaign colluded with Russia to influence the election, they could be an effort to gain Mr. Manafort’s cooperation, legal experts said.

Last week, federal investigators working on a possible plea deal reached out to Mr. Yohai’s attorney and to a Los Angeles-based lender, Genesis Capital LLC, which lent money to entities Mr. Yohai had created for failed house-flipping projects in which Mr. Manafort had also invested, according to some of the people. The investigation has also scrutinized at least one real-estate deal involving Mr. Yohai in New York, The Wall Street Journal previously reported.

It isn’t clear to what charges investigators want Mr. Yohai to plead guilty. Nor could it be determined whether Mr. Yohai would be charged with any wrongdoing if no deal were reached.

Aaron May, a lawyer for Mr. Yohai, said in a statement: “Mr. Yohai has not been charged with any crime nor has he entered into any plea agreements.”

Mr. Manafort’s spokesman, Jason Maloni, said in a statement: “Paul Manafort entered a plea of not guilty in response to the indictment and he looks forward to having these allegations tried before a judge and jury.”

Messrs. Manafort and Yohai worked together on real-estate deals related to multiple properties, both in Los Angeles and New York, court and real-estate records show, including some alleged to have involved loan fraud, according to Mr. Mueller’s indictment.

Mr. Yohai is referred to in Mr. Manafort’s indictment as Mr. Manafort’s son-in-law, but not by name.

Mr. Manafort’s daughter, Jessica, filed for divorce from Mr. Yohai earlier this year. Records show a divorce judgment was issued in August.

Mr. Manafort, his wife and daughter put at least $4.2 million into house-flipping projects, federal bankruptcy-court records show. Mr. Yohai put the four properties into corporate bankruptcy in December 2016, as the lender, Genesis, was moving toward foreclosure, records show.

In September, Mr. Yohai said in a federal court filing in Santa Ana, Calif. that Mr. Manafort and associates had “conspired to mislead” the judge about purchase offers that had materialized for the properties. Mr. Manafort hasn’t responded to that allegation in court filings. A spokesman for Mr. Manafort declined to comment on those allegations.

Earlier this summer, a bankruptcy judge in Santa Ana, Calif. cleared the way for a corporate entity partially owned by Mr. Manafort to buy two of the bankrupt properties, but Mr. Yohai later said in court papers that it appeared the purchaser was having trouble finding a loan. The sales failed to close by an Oct. 20 deadline, court records said.

Genesis was also the lender in early 2016 on a Brooklyn townhouse cited by Mr. Mueller in the indictment accusing Mr. Manafort of loan fraud. Mr. Manafort purchased the property through a corporation for nearly $3 million in 2012 using money from another entity in Cyprus, then took out loans from Genesis in early 2016, in part for construction at the property, according to real-estate records and the indictment.

Genesis got loan guarantees for the Brooklyn property from Mr. Manafort, his wife Kathleen, Mr. Yohai and Jessica Manafort, court records show.

According to the indictment, Mr. Manafort told his tax preparer that the construction loan would allow him to fully pay off the mortgage on another apartment.

After Genesis went to court to foreclose on the Brooklyn property, Mr. Manafort obtained loans from another bank based in Chicago, run by a Trump campaign adviser, and then settled the foreclosure proceedings, the Journal previously has reported.

Mr. Yohai was referred to in Mr. Mueller’s indictment in connection with a Manhattan condominium Mr. Manafort purchased in 2012 through a corporation for $2.85 million, which the government alleged used funds wired from entities he controlled in Cyprus.

Mr. Mueller accused Mr. Manafort of subsequently defrauding a bank when applying for a mortgage on the property. Although the property was used to generate rental income, Mr. Manafort told the bank that it was a second home for his daughter and Mr. Yohai, so he could get a greater loan amount, for $3.185 million, than he could have otherwise, the indictment says.

The indictment says that on Jan. 26, 2016, Mr. Manafort wrote to his then son-in-law about a visit from an appraiser to the condominium, saying, “[r]emember, he believes that you and” Jessica Manafort “are living there.”",politics,

>“They have a passing thought. They think about it more, they fantasize, they slowly build a justification. They prepare, and then when the right set of circumstances comes along, it unleashes the rage.”

That shows compulsive, repetitive, cyclical thinking.  A vivid fantasy that becomes reality.  An inability to abet and deal with rage in a healthy way.  A severance from healthy interpersonal and social connections. 

All of these are hallmarks of extremely poor mental health.  Are they insane in the same way that, say, someone with schizophrenia who believes he's Lincoln is insane?  

No, not usually.  

But we so readily draw a stark line between ""sane"" and ""insane"" because it makes us feel safer.  

The truth is, like any other illness, *everyone* is at risk of developing a mental illness if subjected to the wrong set of genetics and external factors.  Mental illness is no different in that regard. 

This is why gun control needs to evolve beyond ""keep guns out of the hands of crazies.""

>Earlier this summer, a bankruptcy judge in Santa Ana, Calif. cleared the way for a corporate entity partially owned by Mr. Manafort to buy two of the bankrupt properties, but Mr. Yohai later said in court papers that it appeared the purchaser was having trouble finding a loan. The sales failed to close by an Oct. 20 deadline, court records said.

>Genesis was also the lender in early 2016 on a Brooklyn townhouse cited by Mr. Mueller in the indictment accusing Mr. Manafort of loan fraud. Mr. Manafort purchased the property through a corporation for nearly $3 million in 2012 using money from another entity in Cyprus, then took out loans from Genesis in early 2016, in part for construction at the property, according to real-estate records and the indictment.

>Genesis got loan guarantees for the Brooklyn property from Mr. Manafort, his wife Kathleen, Mr. Yohai and Jessica Manafort, court records show.

>According to the indictment, Mr. Manafort told his tax preparer that the construction loan would allow him to fully pay off the mortgage on another apartment.

>After Genesis went to court to foreclose on the Brooklyn property, Mr. Manafort obtained loans from another bank based in Chicago, run by a Trump campaign adviser, and then settled the foreclosure proceedings, the Journal previously has reported.

>Mr. Yohai was referred to in Mr. Mueller’s indictment in connection with a Manhattan condominium Mr. Manafort purchased in 2012 through a corporation for $2.85 million, which the government alleged used funds wired from entities he controlled in Cyprus.


>Mr. Mueller accused Mr. Manafort of subsequently defrauding a bank when applying for a mortgage on the property. Although the property was used to generate rental income, Mr. Manafort told the bank that it was a second home for his daughter and Mr. Yohai, so he could get a greater loan amount, for $3.185 million, than he could have otherwise, the indictment says.

>The indictment says that on Jan. 26, 2016, Mr. Manafort wrote to his then son-in-law about a visit from an appraiser to the condominium, saying, “[r]emember, he believes that you and” Jessica Manafort “are living there.”

It's incredibly short-sighted to alienate people who are waking up, albeit late, to the nightmare of Trumpism. 

I say ""they"" and ""their"" because I didn't vote for Trump and do vote in mid-terms, but you're talking about my demographic group as a whole, and I understand some of the issues apathetic or apolitical white women have seen. 

We grew up believing that a lot of rights our mothers and grandmothers and great-grandmothers fought for were assured to us. ""You can be anything you want,"" we were told, ""maybe even president someday."" The Equal Rights Amendment didn't quite pass during my childhood, but it *almost* did, and that's pretty close. We didn't have to wear dresses, and we could be something other than secretaries, nurses, and teachers.

In college, I was an escort helping women get to the local clinic through Operation Rescue protesters, but I stopped because it was such a fucking beat-down to be called the things I was called, and besides, Operation Rescue didn't win, right? I stopped reading about politics because ""ugh, both parties are a bunch of corrupt scumbags."" I didn't like feminism because feminism was for angry, messy women, not women like me. And so for years, I fell asleep aside from pulling the occasional lever.

It was a lie that lulled me to complacency, and if I was complacent, many other women my age were downright comatose. 

The lie is this: *Your work is done.* You've got the vote, you have careers, you have options. Sure, the president's a pussy-grabber who sees women as just another commodity to enjoy, and Congress still doesn't look much like you, and you're everywhere in middle management but hard to find at the top, but we're living in a post-sexism society. Equality reigns, so if you feel disrespected, harassed, insulted, or ignored politically, that's on *you*, lady.   

That lie no longer covers Trump's ass (or Weinstein's, for that matter). Maybe they -- and I -- should never have gotten so sleepy or been so selfish, but there should be a place for those who are waking up and realizing that voting for [fascists](http://www.rense.com/general37/char.htm) is a good way to be ushered back into the kitchen and the bedroom and the nursery -- see item 5 on the linked list. 

By the way, if you're calling women in our 40s old, I can only assume you're aghast at Elizabeth Warren, Hillary Clinton, Kamala Harris, Nancy Pelosi, and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, to name a few. You're going to want to start voting for people in their 40s and 50s; I promise you the Gen-X politicians will be easier to deal with than most of the boomers are at this point. ",politics,

/r/politics/comments/7cxioz/secret_finding_60_russian_payments_to_finance/dptfo9c/,"Quick guess here...

Dossier stated specifically these 2 things in regards to Embassies and payments: 

>1. On the mechanism for rewarding relevant assets based in the US, and effecting a two-way flow of intelligence and other useful information, Source E claimed that Russian diplomatic staff in key cities such as New York, Washington DC and Miami were using the émigré ‘pension’ distribution system as cover. The operation therefore depended on key people in the US Russian émigré community for its success. Tens of thousands of dollars were involved.

>2. Finally, speaking separately to the same compatriot, a senior Russian MFA official reported that as a prophylactic measure, a leading Russian diplomat, Mikhail KULAGIN, had been withdrawn from Washington at short notice because Moscow feared his heavy involvement in the US presidential election operation, including the so-called veterans’ pensions ruse (reported previously), would be exposed in the media there. His replacement, Andrei BONDAREV however was clean in this regard.

We have corroborating stories that Steele was correct on this from 2 separate sources [BBC](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-39435786) and [McClatchy](http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/nation-world/national/article132761149.html)

Seems plausible to me that based on that reporting FBI was monitoring Kalugin as a spy. Moscow pulled him out, and now FBI is looking into payments which he was involved in as well as likely other RU spies/embassies around the world.

I've seen mention of Manafort notes of payments, the reporting on that issue is all over the place so I'd urge caution there. (We've had mixed reports about what specifically that refers to or if he even had payments as part of his notes)

Read what Felix Sater, a bussiness associate of the President, offered President Trump's personal lawyer Cohen. Sater admits to working with the Kremlin to help get Trump elected. This WaPo article further corroborates the New York Times article you provided.


>In one case, Trump’s personal attorney and a business associate exchanged emails weeks before the Republican National Convention about traveling to an economic conference in Russia that would be attended by top Russian financial and government leaders, including President Vladi­mir Putin, according to people familiar with the correspondence.



>The June 2016 email to Cohen about the economic conference came from Felix Sater, a Russian-born real estate developer and former Trump business associate. Sater encouraged Cohen to attend the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum, with Sater telling Cohen that he could be introduced to Dmitry Medvedev, the Russian prime minister, top financial leaders and perhaps to Putin, according to people familiar with the correspondence. At one point, Sater told Cohen that Putin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, could help arrange the discussions, according to a person familiar with the exchange.^[[1]](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trumps-company-had-more-contact-with-russia-during-campaign-according-to-documents-turned-over-to-investigators/2017/10/02/2091fe5e-a6c0-11e7-850e-2bdd1236be5d_story.html?utm_term=.f61662df4652)



Back in the 90s Felix Sater was caught up in a massive stock scam and flipped on mob families in New York. Guess who flipped him? He's on Special Counsel Mueller's team - Andrew Weissmann.

>Andrew Weissmann was one of the people who prosecuted the 1998 mob stock-scam case during which Felix Sater flipped. The deal Sater got from federal prosecutors at the time was so good that lawyers representing victims of the underlying stock scam are still upset about it—and allege that the prosecutors acted inappropriately in allowing Sater to conceal his past while he was working at Bayrock.

>Put more plainly, Robert Mueller has hired a prosecutor who was previously involved with a case that involved securing the close cooperation of an individual who might (might!) have simultaneously been helping fund Trump projects with laundered money.^[[2]](http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2017/06/21/felix_sater_donald_trump_robert_mueller_and_andrew_weissmann.html)


Felix Sater attended Trump's invite-only victory party to celebrate his presidential victory. Although Trump has tried to distance himself from Sater due to his colourful past, I find it very peculiar that he was allowed into an invite-only event at the Midtown Hilton. 


>From his home on Long Island, Sater orders a late-night ride from a car service. His destination: the invite-only victory party at the Midtown Hilton.

>Driver (name withheld): I picked him up from his house on Long Island. And then, you know, I said, ""Hi, how are you? And he said, ""Do you know who I am?"" And I said, ""No, I don't really know you."" He showed me his business card. I think, to show me that he's VIP, an important person, and second, to tell me that he was happy that he won the election, because it's unexpected.

>So we talked about the election night. After that he just picked up his phone, and he talked all the way from Long Island to New York. He was talking to somebody in the Russian language.^[[3]](https://www.gq.com/story/inside-donald-trumps-election-night-war-room)

There are no loose ends here, and there is not a second, unrelated plot. Manafort, Stone, Sater, Flynn, Trump Jr, Gates, Papadopolous, Sessions, Kushner, Bannon, Mercer, Farage, and anybody else working on the campaign was part of the same multi-prong operation to use Russian assets to bolster Trump's chances of winning, and to build his support to allow him to dispute the election results and provoke violence in the case he lost.",politics,

Right now when a corporation wants to reinvest, expand, give raises or whatever, they get to right that off on taxes. For any (on paper) profitable corp, that means a savings on the top, a 35% rate at the current rate. If the rate lowers to 20%, then companies will only be able to save that amount in taxes.

Put it this way: if a corporation was giving someone a $10k raise, they can deduct that amount  from their taxes, and will save $3500 on their tax bill, so the net payout by the company is $6500. If the tax cuts to 20% go through, the company will then only be able to save $2000 out of that $10k on their tax bill. Do you think the company is going to be indifferent to that payraise suddenly becoming 28% more expensive for them? NO! The accounting department budgeted for -$6500, and thats that. That $10k payraise now has to be lowered to $7800 to be budget neutral to the company. Sorry about that, its just the way these things work out.

> We chose this particular tax threshold because, as Mr. Stephenson mentioned, House Republicans are proposing to reduce the federal statutory corporate tax rate to 20 percent, down from the current 35 percent. President Trump wants an even deeper cut, down to 15 percent.

> **If claims about the job-creation benefits of lower tax rates had any validity, these 92 consistently profitable firms would be among the nation’s strongest job creators. Instead, we found just the opposite.**

> The companies we reviewed had a median job-growth rate over the past nine years of nearly negative 1 percent, compared with 6 percent for the private sector as a whole. Of those 92 companies, 48 got rid of a combined total of 483,000 jobs.

/r/politics/comments/7d4d1x/trump_is_not_a_despot_but_hed_like_to_play_one/dpuv8c5/,">President Trump showed us once again on his Asia trip that he is a wannabe despot — a man who mimics authoritarian strongmen as much as he idolizes them on the global stage. The former host of The Apprentice has now become the despot’s apprentice. He is the kind of demagogue that America’s Founding Fathers warned us about. American democracy is now under threat.

>Of course, Trump is not a despot. Claiming so is alarmist, and it diminishes the severity of suffering that true despots inflict on their populations — suffering I’ve seen firsthand researching authoritarianism in sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and behind the former Iron Curtain of the post-Soviet states.

>But in policy foreign and domestic, it’s clear that Trump is jealous of the unchecked powers of autocrats — as he simultaneously applauds their destructive regimes abroad.

>Take Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines, whom Trump warmly praised this week at a stop in Manila. Just before being elected last year, Duterte pledged that his regime would be a “bloody” one. He signaled to his officers that they would get presidential pardons for extrajudicial killings in his so-called drug war. “I will issue 1,000 pardons a day,” Duterte promised, before pledging to pardon himself for mass atrocities. “Pardon given to Rodrigo Duterte for the crime of multiple murder, signed Rodrigo Duterte,” he said with a laugh.

>Duterte kept his word. Since taking power last year, Duterte’s regime has slaughtered  thousands. The Filipino strongman has previously boasted about personally killing people — riding around on a motorcycle hunting for victims; tossing a man out of a helicopter; and shooting three people personally. He pledged to be the Hitler of the Philippines and lamented “what a waste” it was that he didn’t have first crack at a gang rape victim.

>Thankfully, Donald Trump called Duterte “sick,” decried his “agenda of hate” and pointedly said that his extrajudicial killings were “disgraceful.” In response to Duterte’s bogus denials of his mass atrocities, Trump called them “just made up” and “dishonest,” and said they make clear that Duterte’s regime is filled with “truly bad people!”

>Nope, just kidding. That’s not what Trump said about a despot who is massacring thousands. Those are things that the president of the United States said about America’s free press — a foundational pillar of democracy.

>What Trump has actually said about Duterte is quite different. “I just wanted to congratulate you because I am hearing of the unbelievable job on the drug problem,” Trump told him in a phone call in April, according to a leaked transcript. “You are a good man … Keep up (the) good work, you are doing an amazing job.” This week in Manila, Trump boasted about their “great relationship” and the two men laughed about Duterte’s quip that journalists are “spies.” Since 1992, 134 journalists have been murdered in the Philippines

>...

>Such praise from the White House legitimizes the rule of tyrants and helps them stay in power. It also undercuts American soft power, which is partly predicated on the moral leadership of the United States.

>Unfortunately, Trump’s pro-authoritarian impulses are not limited to foreign soil. Trump also aspires to be the first authoritarian strongman of Washington. Despite the checks and balances that constrain him, he is steadily eroding democratic norms and menacing our system of democratic government.

>Trump attacks the press, lies constantly, calls to jail his opponents, pardons his political allies, aims to suppress votes in future elections, uses divide and rule tactics to scapegoat minorities, routinely violates democratic ethics and tries to politicize non-partisan institutions. And, like the banana republics of the world, he’s filled the White House with family members, unqualified cronies, and generals.

>Thankfully, Trump is a bumbling, ineffective demagogue. Yet, as I’ve written previously, Trump doesn’t have to be effective to be destructive. He already is changing the perceptions of what is acceptable, normal and within-bounds in American democracy. Millions of his supporters cheer as he violates democratic norms. Trump’s erosion of American democracy is happening — and it’s going to take years or decades to repair.

From the picture, it's not clear that he groped her (though it's quite plausible).  You can tell from the shadows under each of his fingers on his left hand and his index finger on his right hand that he wasn't touching her (though he was very close, and may have indeed groped her).  Even if it was just a visual gag, it's creepy and distasteful and behaviour fitting of a 13 year old boy, not a senator.

The kissing accusation is perhaps even more damning as that's a blatant abuse of power and paints the picture of him being extremely predatory.  I trust Leeann Tweeden, but if Franken denies it I'm not sure what I'll think.  

In my view, if Franken behaved this horrifically, there will surely be other accusers.  It seems pretty implausible that he just decided at the age of 55, after around 35 years in the entertainment industry that it was appropriate to start acting like a creep and preying on women.  That is to say, men who prey on women generally have a history/pattern of it (Moore, Weinstein, C.K., etc) and don't wait until they are 55 to do it only once.

That said, even if Franken denies it and no one else comes forward I'm not saying that Mrs. Tweeden's account should not be trusted.  I'm not sure what I should think.  I thought Franken was one of the few truly decent politicians who could be trusted and now my worldview has been shaken.",politics,

I really liked you, Franken, both as a Senator and as a comedown. You were good enough, smart enough, and gosh darn it, I liked you!

But, like all powerful people who use their power to intimidate and abuse others, you need to step down, or we need to remove you.  You’re no longer worthy of the power the people have bestowed upon you, and it now needs to be taken away from you. 


And your “apology” is shit, and just confirms the need for your removal.

Take the U.K. which is only a constitutional monorachy with the monarchs influence so well curtailed that's it's pretty much indistinguishable from a democracy. France was a replublic. Many of the other members of the allied side were to all intents and purposes democratic.

Note also that the war was largely engineered and provoked by Germany and Austria-Hungary. The latter imposed terms on Serbia that were deliberately impossible to accept and Germany fully supported them in doing so: they were both spoiling for a fight and wanted it to happen then while they perceived they had the maximum advantage in military power. 

Contrast that with Allied powers such as the UK joining the war to defend smaller nations such as Belgium. And for further proof go and look up what happened to occupied Belgium. The only reason they're being forgotten as the villains of history is that a bunch of even bigger monsters a couple of decades later eclipsed that.

>>When I saw the script, Franken had written a moment when his character comes at me for a ‘kiss’. I suspected what he was after, but I figured I could turn my head at the last minute, or put my hand over his mouth, to get more laughs from the crowd.

>>On the day of the show Franken and I were alone backstage going over our lines one last time. He said to me, “We need to rehearse the kiss.” I laughed and ignored him. Then he said it again. I said something like, ‘Relax Al, this isn’t SNL…we don’t need to rehearse the kiss.’

>>He continued to insist, and I was beginning to get uncomfortable.

>>He repeated that actors really need to rehearse everything and that we must practice the kiss. I said ‘OK’ so he would stop badgering me. We did the line leading up to the kiss and then he came at me, put his hand on the back of my head, mashed his lips against mine and aggressively stuck his tongue in my mouth.

>>I immediately pushed him away with both of my hands against his chest and told him if he ever did that to me again I wouldn’t be so nice about it the next time.

>>I walked away. All I could think about was getting to a bathroom as fast as possible to rinse the taste of him out of my mouth.

>>I felt disgusted and violated.

>>Not long after, I performed the skit as written, carefully turning my head so he couldn’t kiss me on the lips.

>>...Franken repaid me with petty insults, including drawing devil horns on at least one of the headshots I was autographing for the troops.

>The last thing an investigator wants to do is modify the evidence. Every modification, every save, and every annotation results in a change to the data. Even if you do not intentionally edit the picture, anything other than a byte-per-byte copy results in a modification to the file. 

>One of the most common mistakes happens when people pass evidence to an investigator. They may scale the picture larger, brighten the image, or annotate it with circles and arrows so that the investigator knows where they should be looking. Pictures may also be spliced together (side-by-side) or given an attractive border. 

>However, each of these alterations fail to retain the integrity of the evidence. The user may think that they are helping by making something easier to see, but they are really altering the evidence: obscuring potentially critical details in the image, lowering the quality with a resave, and stripping metadata. 

>**Alterations are also common for pictures found online.** An original photo may be resized for the web (modification #1), uploaded to Facebook (modification #2), downloaded, cropped (#3), uploaded to Imgur (#4), copied from Imgur, brightened (#5), and posted to Twitter (#6), and so on. A viral photo can quickly undergo dozens or hundreds of alterations. Each modification changes the image and makes evaluating the content more difficult.

Unless you believe Linda Tripp and multiple friends of Willey who have testified that she sought a sexual relationship with him. It muddies the waters quite a bit, especially since we were years away from the ""affirmative consent"" standard we have now that if she was trying to nail him. 

He's still a scumbag, and I'm sure he inappropriately groped her in the office, but if she wanted him too it's complicated, no? Same with Lewinsky. It's complicated.

So that leaves Flowers (a long term affair, real classy Bill), Jones (with whom he settled for $850k for exposing himself) and Broderick. 

I think Jones is the one that is most applicable to what's happening today. Men of a certain age and power status apparently think whipping their penis out in front of people who are below them is totally cool! I definitely hear echoes of Louis C.K. in this one. And his comments about why he wouldn't have gone after Willey because of her looks are disgustingly Trumpish. But that all leads us to what we already know. Bill Clinton was the 90s poster child for toxic masculinity. But we've kind of already dealt with this stuff in very, very, very public trials way back when. Especially Paula Jones.

So that leaves Broderick. She has the strangest story with the most inconsistencies... and he doesn't have a pattern of doing anything like this. But people do strange things after they are raped. And if he did do it? This would be the one worth revisiting, because the implications are off the charts. That said... I leave this up to her.

>Called by Senator Bob Corker to consider “the conditions under which the president could order the use of nuclear weapons,” the hearing was officially held for the purpose of discussing “the potential for legislation that would require congressional approval for the use of those weapons.”

>The outcome of the hearing was categorical: The president’s power to order a nuclear holocaust is total and unquestionable, and no one in Congress is calling seriously for changing that state of affairs.
